<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HIS volume contains the substance
of a course of popular Lectures delivered
at Cardiff in 1901. The work
does not claim in any way to be an
original contribution to knowledge, and is
published on the recommendation of some
friends in whose literary judgment I have
confidence. In a popular book of this
kind I have not thought it necessary to
give detailed references to authorities, but
a list of a few of the books which I used
in the preparation of the Lectures, and
which are likely to be interesting to
readers of Welsh history, may be useful.
Among medi&aelig;val works I may mention
the two Welsh chronicles&mdash;the Annales
Cambri&aelig; and the Brut y Tywysogion,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg&nbsp;vi]</a></span>
both published in the Rolls Series;
Geoffrey of Monmouth&rsquo;s &ldquo;History of the
Kings of Britain&rdquo; (translated in Bohn&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Six Old English Chronicles&rdquo;); Giraldus
Cambrensis, &ldquo;The Itinerary and Description
of Wales&rdquo; (translated in Bohn&rsquo;s
library); the prefaces, especially those by
Brewer, in the Rolls Series edition of
Giraldus, will be found interesting. Of
the English chroniclers, Ordericus Vitalis,
Roger of Wendover, and Matthew Paris
are perhaps the most valuable for the history
of Wales and the Marches during the
twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Among
modern books, the reader may be referred
to Rhys and Jones, &ldquo;The Welsh People&rdquo;;
Freeman, &ldquo;William Rufus&rdquo;; Thomas
Stephens, &ldquo;Literature of the Kymry&rdquo;;
Henry Owen, &ldquo;Gerald the Welshman&rdquo;;
Clark, &ldquo;Medi&aelig;val Military Architecture,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;The Land of Morgan&rdquo;; Newell,
&ldquo;History of the Welsh Church&rdquo;; Tout,
&ldquo;Edward I.&rdquo;; and the &ldquo;Dictionary of
National Biography.&rdquo; Since these Lectures
were delivered at least three books
on Welsh history have appeared which
deserve mention: Mr. Bradley&rsquo;s &ldquo;Owen
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg&nbsp;vii]</a></span>
Glyndwr,&rdquo; with a summary of earlier
Welsh history; Mr. Owen Edwards&rsquo;s
charmingly written volume in the Story
of the Nations Series; and Mr. Morris&rsquo;s
valuable work on &ldquo;The Welsh Wars of
Edward I.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The maps are taken from large wall
maps which I used when lecturing. In
drawing up the map of Wales and the
Marches at the beginning of the thirteenth
century, I had the assistance of my friend
and former pupil, Mr. Morgan Jones,
M.A., of Ferndale, who generously placed
at my disposal the results of his researches
into the history of the Welsh Marches.</p>

<h2>I</h2>

<h3>INTRODUCTORY</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N the following lectures no attempt
will be made to give a systematic
account of a political development,
which is the ordinary theme of history.
History is &ldquo;past politics&rdquo; in the wide
sense of the word. It has to do with
the growth and decay of states and
institutions, and their relations to each
other. The history of Wales in the
Middle Ages, viewed from the political
standpoint, is a failure; its interest is
negative; and in this introductory lecture
I intend to discuss &ldquo;the failure of the
nation&rdquo; (to use the words of Professor
Rhys and Mr. Brynmor Jones) &ldquo;to effect
any stable and lasting political combination.&rdquo;
Wales failed to produce or
develope political institutions of an enduring
character&mdash;failed to become a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg&nbsp;4]</a></span>
state. Its history does not possess the
unity nor the kind of interest which the
history of England possesses, and which
makes the study of English history so
peculiarly instructive to the student of
politics. In English history we study
primarily the growth of the principle of
Representative Government, which we
can trace for centuries through a long
series of authoritative records. That is
the great gift of England to the world.
Not only has Wales entered on this
inheritance; it helped to create it. It
was Llywelyn ap Iorwerth who began
the revolt against John which led to the
Great Charter, and the clauses of the
Great Charter itself show that it was the
joint work of English and Welsh. Wales
again exerted a decisive influence on the
Barons&rsquo; War&mdash;the troubles in which the
House of Commons first emerged. And
Wales&mdash;half of it for more than six
hundred years&mdash;half of it for nearly four
hundred&mdash;has lived under the public law
and administrative system which the
Norman and Angevin kings of England
built up on Anglo-Saxon foundations.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg&nbsp;5]</a></span>
This public law and this administrative
system have become part and parcel of
the life and history of Wales. The
constitutional history of England is one
of the elements which go to make up
the complex history of Wales.</p>

<p>The history of Wales, taken by itself,
is constitutionally weak; and its interest is
social or personal, arch&aelig;ological, artistic,
literary&mdash;anything but political. And the
fact&mdash;which is indisputable&mdash;that Wales
failed to establish any permanent or united
political system needs explanation.</p>

<p>The ultimate explanation will perhaps
be found in the geography of the country.
The mountains have done much to preserve
the independence and the language
of Wales, but they have kept her people
disunited; and the Welsh needed a long
drilling under institutions, which could only
grow up in a land less divided by nature,
before they could develope their political
genius.</p>

<p>Wales, owing largely to its geography,
had the misfortune never to be conquered
at one fell swoop by an alien race of
conquerors. Such a conquest may not at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg&nbsp;6]</a></span>
first sight strike one as a blessing, but it
is, if it takes place when a people is in
an early, fluid, and impressionable stage,
as may be seen from a comparison of
countries which have undergone it with
countries which have not&mdash;a comparison,
for instance, of England with Ireland or
Germany. Perhaps the nearest parallel
in the history of Wales to the Norman
Conquest of England is the conquest of
Wales by Cunedda, the founder of the
Cymric kingdom, in the dark and troublous
times which followed the withdrawal of
the Roman troops from Britain. But
though an invader and a conqueror,
Cunedda was not an alien; he spoke
the same language as the people he
conquered and belonged to the same
race to which the most important part
of them belonged. And this militated
against his chances of becoming a founder
of Welsh unity. A race of conquerors
distinct from the conquered in blood and
language and civilisation, must hold together
for a time; they form an official
governing class, enforcing the same principles
of government, and establishing a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg&nbsp;7]</a></span>
uniform administration throughout the
country. And the uniform pressure reacts
on the conquered, turning them from a
loose group of tribes into a nation. This
is what the Norman Conquest did for
England. But if the conquerors are of
the same race and language as the conquered,
they readily mix with them;
instead of holding together they identify
themselves with local jealousies and tribal
aspirations. This happened again and
again in Germany. A Saxon emperor
sends a Saxon to govern Bavaria as its
duke and hold it loyal to the central
government; the Saxon duke almost
instantaneously becomes a Bavarian&mdash;the
champion of tribal independence against
the central government; and so the
Germans remained a loose group of
tribes and states&mdash;a divided people.
This illustration suggests one of the
reasons why Cunedda&rsquo;s conquest failed
to unite Wales.</p>

<p>Again the custom of sharing landed
property among all the sons tended to
prevent the growth of Welsh unity.
Socially it appears far more just and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg&nbsp;8]</a></span>
reasonable than the custom of primogeniture.
It is with the growth of
feudalism (already apparent in the Welsh
laws of the tenth century) that its political
dangers become evident. The essence of
feudalism is the confusion of political
power and landed property; the ruler is
lord of the land, the landlord is the ruler.
If landed property is divided, political
power is divided. When the Lord Rhys
died in 1197 leaving four sons, Deheubarth
had four rulers and formed four
states instead of one; and civil war
ensued.</p>

<p>The unity of Welsh history is not to
be found in the growth of a state or a
political system. But may we regard the
history of Wales as a long and heroic
struggle inspired by the idea of nationality?
A caution is necessary here. It
is one of the besetting sins of historians
to read the ideas of the present into the
past; and to the general public historical
study is dull unless they can do so. It is
very difficult to avoid doing so; it needs a
severe training, a long immersion in the
past, and a steady passion for truth above
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg&nbsp;9]</a></span>
all things. In no case perhaps is this
warning so necessary as in matters involving
the idea of nationality. This is
characteristic of the present age, but it has
not been characteristic of any other to
anything like the same extent. We live
in an atmosphere of nationality; we have
seen it create the German Empire and
the kingdom of Italy, and the Welsh
University; we see it now labouring to
break up the Austrian Empire, and
perhaps changing the unchanging East.
But the whole history of Europe shows
that it is an idea of slow and comparatively
late growth. The first appearance
of nationality as a conscious principle of
political action is found in England&mdash;and
possibly in France&mdash;at the beginning of
the thirteenth century, and in Wales
about the same time; in the other
countries of Europe much later. And it
was very rarely till the very end of the
eighteenth century that it became a
dominant factor in politics. Of course our
ancestors always hated a foreigner&mdash;but
they did not love their fellow-countrymen.
The one thing a man hated more than
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg&nbsp;10]</a></span>
being driven out of house and home by
a foreign invader, was being driven out
by his next-door neighbour; and, as his
neighbour was more likely to do it, and
when he did it, to stay, he hated his
neighbour most. A certain degree of
order and settled government was necessary
before the national idea could become
effective.</p>

<p>In medi&aelig;val Wales it never succeeded
in uniting the people; the petty patriotism
of the family stood in the way of the larger
patriotism of the nation; local rivalries
and jealousies were always stronger than
the sense of national unity. The attempt
of Llywelyn ap Iorwerth to create a
National Council, like the Great Council
of England, died with him. In the final
struggle with Edward I., when for a few
months the idea of Welsh unity was nearest
realisation in action, the men of Glamorgan
fought on the winning side. Read the
&ldquo;Brut y Tywysogion&rdquo; and consider how
far the actions there related can have been
inspired by the feeling of nationality.
Here is the account in the &ldquo;Brut&rdquo; of
what was happening in Wales in 1200
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg&nbsp;11]</a></span>
and the following years, the period
represented by our map.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;1200. One thousand and two hundred
was the year of Christ when Gruffudd, son
of Cynan, son of Owain, died, after taking
upon him the religious habit, at Aberconway,&mdash;the
man who was known by all in
the isle of Britain for the extent of his gifts,
and his kindness and goodness; and no
wonder, for as long as the men who are
now shall live, they will remember his
renown, and his praise and his deeds. In
that year, Maelgwn, son of Rhys, sold
Aberteivi, the key of all Wales, for a
trifling value, to the English, for fear of
and out of hatred to his brother Gruffudd.
The same year, Madog, son of Gruffudd
Maelor, founded the monastery of Llanegwestl,
near the old cross, in Yale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;1201. The ensuing year, Llywelyn,
son of Iorwerth, subdued the cantrev of
Lleyn, having expelled Maredudd, son of
Cynan, on account of his treachery. That
year on the eve of Whitsunday, the monks
of Strata Florida came to the new church;
which had been erected of splendid
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg&nbsp;12]</a></span>
workmanship. A little while afterwards, about
the feast of St. Peter and St. Paul, Maredudd,
son of Rhys, an extremely courteous young
man, the terror of his enemies, the love of
his friends, being like a lightning of fire
between armed hosts, the hope of the
South Wales men, the dread of England,
the honour of the cities, and the ornament
of the world, was slain at Carnwyllon; and
Gruffudd, his brother, took possession of his
castle at Llanymddyvri. And the cantrev,
in which it was situated, was taken possession
of by Gruffudd, his brother. And
immediately afterwards, on the feast of
St. James the Apostle, Gruffudd, son of
Rhys, died at Strata Florida, having taken
upon him the religious habit; and there
he was buried. That year there was an
earthquake at Jerusalem.</p>

<p>&ldquo;1202. The ensuing year, Maredudd, son
of Cynan, was expelled from Meirionydd,
by Howel, son of Gruffudd, his nephew,
son of his brother, and was despoiled of
everything but his horse. That year the
eighth day after the feast of St. Peter and
St. Paul, the Welsh fought against the
castle of Gwerthrynion, which was the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg&nbsp;13]</a></span>
property of Roger Mortimer, and compelled
the garrison to deliver up the castle,
before the end of a fortnight, and they
burned it to the ground. That year about
the first feast of St. Mary in the autumn,
Llywelyn, son of Iorwerth, raised an army
from Powys, to bring Gwenwynwyn under
his subjection, and to possess the country.
For though Gwenwynwyn was near to him
as to kindred, he was a foe to him as to
deeds. And on his march he called to
him all the other princes, who were related
to him, to combine in making war together
against Gwenwynwyn. And when Elise,
son of Madog, son of Maredudd, became
acquainted therewith, he refused to combine
in the presence of all; and with all
his energy he endeavoured to bring about
a peace with Gwenwynwyn. And therefore,
after the clergy and the religious had
concluded a peace between Gwenwynwyn
and Llywelyn, the territory of Elise, son
of Madog, his uncle, was taken from him.
And ultimately there was given him for
maintenance, in charity, the castle of
Crogen, with seven small townships.
And thus, after conquering the castle of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg&nbsp;14]</a></span>
Bala, Llywelyn returned back happily.
That year about the feast of St. Michael,
the family of young Rhys, son of Gruffudd,
son of the lord Rhys, obtained possession
of the castle of Llanymddyvri.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>One may almost say that Wales is
Wales to-day in spite of her political history.
Wales owes far more to her poets
and men of letters than to her princes and
their politics.</p>

<p>Giraldus Cambrensis laid his finger on
the spot, when he said: &ldquo;Happy would
Wales be if it had one prince, and that a
good one.&rdquo; A necessary preliminary to
the union of Welshmen was the wiping
out of all independent Welsh princes
except one. Till that happened local
feeling would always remain stronger
than national feeling; the disintegrating
forces of family feuds and personal ambitions
and clannish loyalty would always
outweigh the sense of national unity.</p>

<p>The Lords of the Marches were slowly
doing this for Wales; they were wiping
out all the independent Welsh princes
except one. We may see the process
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg&nbsp;15]</a></span>
going on in the accompanying map, which
gives the chief political divisions of Wales
at the beginning of the thirteenth century,
and we will turn for a few minutes to consider
the fortunes of some of these petty
states and the manner of the men who
ruled them.</p>

<p>The great Palatine Earldom of Chester,
a kingdom within the kingdom, was ruled
before 1100 by Hugh the Wolf, of
Avranches, who conquered for a time
the north coast of Wales. In Anglesey
he built a castle, and kennelled the hounds
he loved so well in a church, to find them
all mad the next morning. The stories of
his savage mutilation of his Welsh prisoners
show that he merited the name of &ldquo;the
Wolf.&rdquo; Yet he was the friend of the holy
Anselm, and died a monk. The struggle
between Chester and Gwynedd for the
possession of the Four Cantreds, the lands
between the Conway and the Dee, was
almost perpetual during the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries, and the fortune of war
continually changing. With the extinction
of the old line of the Earls of Chester
(1237) and the grant of the earldom to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg&nbsp;16]</a></span>
Prince Edward (1254), a new era opened
for Wales.</p>

<p>Further south, in the Middle March, along
the upper valleys of the Severn and the
Wye, the great power of the Mortimers was
growing. They had already stretched out a
long arm to grasp Gwerthrynion. But the
greatest expansion of their power came
later, under Roger Mortimer, grandson of
Llywelyn ap Iorwerth, friend of Edward I.
in the wild days of his youth, persistent
foe of Llywelyn ap Gruffydd; and soon
the Mortimer lands embraced all Mid-Wales
and reached the sea, and a Mortimer
was strong enough to depose and
murder a king and rule England as
paramour of the queen. Savage as the
Mortimers were, they were mild compared
with one of their predecessors.
Robert Count of Bellesme and Ponthieu,
the great castle builder of his time, became
Earl of Shrewsbury and Arundel in 1098.
Men had heard tales of his ferocity on the
Continent&mdash;how he starved his prisoners
to death rather than hold them to ransom;
how, when besieging a castle, he threw in
the horses to fill up the moat, and when
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg&nbsp;17]</a></span>
these were not enough he gave orders to
seize the villeins and throw them in, that
his battering rams might go forward on a
writhing mass of living human bodies.
These tales seemed incredible in England,
but the men of the Middle March believed
them when they were &ldquo;flayed alive by the
iron claws&rdquo; of the devil of Bellesme. In
his rebellion against Henry I. the princes
of Gwynedd supported him, till their army
was bought over by the lying promises of
the king; but the day when the Earl of
Shrewsbury surrendered to King Henry
and the whole force of England was a
day of deliverance alike to England and
to Wales.</p>

<p>We next come to the group of lordships
held about this time by William de
Braose, lord of Bramber in Sussex. They
stretched from Radnor to Gower, from
the Monnow to the Llwchwr, and included
the castles of Builth, Brecon,
Abergavenny. But he held these lands
by different titles, and they were never
welded together. William de Braose
began his public career by calling the
princes of Gwent to a conference at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg&nbsp;18]</a></span>
Abergavenny, and massacring them. He
was on intimate terms with King John,
who gave Prince Arthur into his keeping;
but this was a piece of work which
even De Braose recoiled from, and he
refused to burden his soul with Arthur&rsquo;s
murder. A few years later John suddenly
turned against him, and demanded
his sons as hostages. His wife, Maud de
St. Val&eacute;rie, who lived long in the popular
memory as a witch, sent back the answer:
she would not entrust her children to a
man who had murdered his nephew. The
king chased Braose from his lands, caught
his wife and eldest son, and starved them
to death in Windsor Castle. The Braose
family continued to hold Gower, but the
rest of their possessions passed to other
houses&mdash;Brecon to the Bohuns of Hereford,
Elvael to Mortimer, Abergavenny to
Hastings, Builth first to Mortimer and
then to the Crown.</p>

<p>Glamorgan, during our period, was
attached to the earldom of Gloucester.
From Fitzhamon the Conqueror it
passed, through his daughter, to Robert
of Gloucester, and early in the thirteenth
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg&nbsp;19]</a></span>
century to the great house of Clare, Earls
of Gloucester and Hertford, who held the
balance between parties in the Barons&rsquo;
War. With the organisation of Glamorgan
and with its great rulers we shall
deal later. At the time represented by
our map, it was in the hands of King
John, who obtained it by marriage. John
divorced his wife in 1200, but managed to
keep her inheritance till nearly the end of
his reign; and Fawkes de Br&eacute;aut&eacute;, the
most infamous of his mercenary captains,
lorded it in Cardiff Castle.</p>

<p>Further west, between the Llwchwr and
the Towy, lay the lordship of Kidweli,
held by the De Londres family, who had
accompanied Fitzhamon in the conquest
of Glamorgan, and were lords of Ogmore
and founders of Ewenny. One episode in
the history of this family may be mentioned&mdash;the
battle in the Vale of Towy in 1136,
when Gwenllian, the heroic wife of Rhys
ap Gruffydd, led her husband&rsquo;s forces
against Maurice and De Londres, and
was defeated and slain by the Lord of
Kidweli. Her death was soon avenged
by the slaughter of the Normans at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg&nbsp;20]</a></span>
Cardigan. The present castle of Kidweli
dates from the later thirteenth century,
before the war of 1277, after the
lordship had passed to the Chaworths.</p>

<p>In the extreme west, in Dyfed, the land
of fiords, Arnulf of Montgomery had
early founded the Norman power, but he
was involved in the fall of his brother,
Robert of Bellesme, and Henry I. tried
to form the land into an English shire,
and planted a colony of Flemings in
&ldquo;Little England beyond Wales.&rdquo; But it
was too far off for the royal power to
be effectively exercised there, and the
Earldom of Pembroke was granted to
a branch of the De Clares, who had
already conquered Ceredigion, and built
castles at Cardigan and Aberystwyth.
The De Clares also held Chepstow and
lands in Lower Gwent. The Earldom
itself was smaller than the present shire
of Pembroke, and William Marshall, who
succeeded the De Clares through his
marriage with the daughter of Richard
Strongbow (1189), owed his commanding
position in English history of the thirteenth
century far more to his personal
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg&nbsp;21]</a></span>
qualities, his courage and wisdom and
patriotism, than to his territorial possessions.</p>

<p>It was by driving the De Clares out of
Ceredigion in Stephen&rsquo;s reign that Rhys
ap Gruffydd laid the foundation of his
power, and raised Deheubarth to be the
foremost of the native principalities.
The Lord Rhys was clever and farseeing
enough to win the confidence of Henry II.,
and received from him the title of Justiciar&mdash;or
King&rsquo;s Deputy&mdash;in South Wales. As
long as Owain Gwynedd lived the unusual
spectacle was seen of a prince of South
Wales and a prince of North Wales
working harmoniously together. But after
Owain&rsquo;s death (1170) Rhys fought with
his successors over the possession of
Merioneth, while Owain Cyfeiliog, the
poet-prince of Powys, did all he could
to thwart him. In 1197 the death of
Rhys, &ldquo;the head and the shield and the
strength of the South and of all Wales,&rdquo;
and the civil wars among his sons, opened
his principality again to the encroachment
of foes on all sides, and removed one danger
from Powys. Powys, however, was being
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg&nbsp;22]</a></span>
steadily squeezed by the pressure of
Gwynedd on one side, and the growing
power of Mortimer on the other, and its
princes resorted to a shifty diplomacy and
a general adherence&mdash;open or secret as
circumstances dictated&mdash;to the English
Crown, till they sank at length into the
position of petty feudatories of the English
king.</p>

<p>The Prince of Gwynedd alone upheld
the standard of Welsh nationality, the
dragon of Welsh independence; only in
Gwynedd and its dependencies did the
Welsh public law prevail over feudal
custom. And what was the result?
Exactly what Giraldus Cambrensis had
foreseen and longed for. The eyes of
Welshmen everywhere began to turn to
the Lord of Eryri, the one hope of Wales.
It was an alluring&mdash;an inspiring prospect,
which opened before the princes of
Gwynedd&mdash;to head a national movement,
drive out the foreigners, and unite all
Wales under their sway. Llywelyn ap
Iorwerth, at the end of his long reign,
deliberately rejected the dream. That is
the meaning of his emphatic declaration
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg&nbsp;23]</a></span>
of fidelity and submission to Henry III.
in 1237. &ldquo;Llywelyn, Prince of Wales, by
special messengers sent word to the king
that, as his time of life required that he
should thenceforth abandon all strife and
tumult of war, and should for the future
enjoy peace, he had determined to place
himself and his possessions under the
authority and protection of him, the English
king, and would hold his lands from
him in all fealty and friendship, and enter
into an indissoluble treaty; and if the king
should go on any expedition he would, to
the best of his power, as his liege subject,
promote it, by assisting him with troops,
arms, horses, and money.&rdquo; Llywelyn the
Great refused to dispute the suzerainty of
England. This may appear pusillanimous
to the enthusiastic patriot, but subsequent
events proved the old statesman&rsquo;s wisdom
and clearsightedness. His successors were
less cautious, were carried away by the
patriotism round them and the syren
voices of the bards. And to Llywelyn ap
Gruffydd the prospect was even more
tempting than to Llywelyn ap Iorwerth.
The Barons&rsquo; War weakened the power of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg&nbsp;24]</a></span>
England, and the necessities of Simon de
Montfort led him to enter into an alliance
with Llywelyn. The expansion of Gwynedd
was great and rapid. Llywelyn&rsquo;s
rule extended as far south as Merthyr,
and made itself felt on the shores of
Carmarthen Bay. The Earl of Gloucester
found it necessary to build Caerphilly
Castle to uphold his influence in
Glamorgan. But it was just the expansion
of Llywelyn&rsquo;s power which forced
Edward I. to overthrow him once for all.
&ldquo;We hold it better&rdquo;&mdash;so ran Edward&rsquo;s
proclamation in 1282&mdash;&ldquo;that, for the
common weal, we and the inhabitants of
our land should be wearied by labours
and expenses this once, although the
burden seem heavy, in order to destroy
their wickedness altogether, than that we
should in future times, as so often in the
past, be tormented by rebellions of this
kind at their good pleasure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Principality&rdquo; now became shire
land&mdash;under English laws and English
administration. The rest of Wales remained
divided up into Marcher Lordships
for another two hundred and fifty
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg&nbsp;25]</a></span>
years, under feudal laws&mdash;a continual
source of disturbance and scene of disorder.
These were the lands in which
the King&rsquo;s Writ did not run, where (to
summarise the description in the Statute
of 1536) &ldquo;murders and house-burnings,
robberies and riots are committed with
impunity, and felons are received, and
escape from justice by going from one
lordship to another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yet the Marcher Lords did something
for Welsh civilisation in their earlier
centuries. Guided by enlightened self-interest,
they often founded towns, granting
considerable privileges to them in
order to attract burgesses&mdash;such as low
rents, and freedom from arbitrary fines.
Fairs, too, were established and protected
by the Lords Marchers. The early lords
of Glamorgan seem to have been specially
successful in this respect; in the twelfth
century immigrants from other parts of
Wales are said to have come to reside in
Glamorgan, owing to the privileges and
comparative security which were to be
found there. Nor perhaps has it been
sufficiently recognised how soon the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg&nbsp;26]</a></span>
Lords of the Marches began drilling
their Welsh subjects in Anglo-Norman
methods of local self-government. Most
of the greater Marcher Lords possessed
estates in England; not a few of them,
such as William de Braose, served as
sheriffs in English shires; some, such
as John de Hastings, were judges in the
royal courts. They introduced into Wales
methods of government which they learnt
in England, and institutions with a great
future before them, like the Franco-Roman
&ldquo;inquest by sworn recognitors,&rdquo;
from which trial by jury was developed,
were soon acclimatised in the Marches of
Wales.</p>

<h2>II</h2>

<h3>GEOFFREY OF MONMOUTH</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>HEN Geoffrey of Monmouth wrote,
Norman influence in Wales was at
its height. In the old days we used to
begin English history with William the
Conqueror; since Freeman wrote his five
thick volumes and proved&mdash;not that the
Norman Conquest was unimportant&mdash;but
that it did not involve a breach of continuity,
a new start in national life, the
pendulum has swung too much the other
way, and the tendency of late years has
been to underestimate the importance of
the Norman Conquest.</p>

<p>The Norman wherever he went brought
little that was new; he was but a Norseman&mdash;a
Viking&mdash;with a French polish.
He had no law of his own; he had forgotten
his own language, he had no literature.
But he had the old Norse energy;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg&nbsp;30]</a></span>
which not only drove him or his ancestors
to settle and conquer in lands so distant
and diverse as Russia and Sicily, Syria
and North America, but enabled him to
infuse new life into the countries he conquered.
Further, he still retained that
adaptability and power of assimilation
which is characteristic of peoples in a
primitive stage of civilisation. With a
wonderful instinct he fastened on to the
most characteristic and strongest features
of the different nations he was brought in
contact with, developed them, gave them
permanent form, and often a world-wide
importance.</p>

<p>The Norman conquerors were not
always fortunate in their selection. Ireland
has little to thank them for. The most
striking characteristic which they found in
Ireland was anarchy, and they brought it
to a high pitch of perfection. To quote
Sir J. Davies&rsquo;s luminous discourse on
Ireland, in 1612: &ldquo;Finding the Irish
exactions to be more profitable than the
English rents and services, and loving the
Irish tyranny which was tied to no rules
of law and honour better than a just and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg&nbsp;31]</a></span>
lawful seigniory, they did reject the
English law and government, received the
Irish laws and customs, took Irish surnames,
as MacWilliam, MacFeris, refused
to come to Parliaments, and scorned to
obey those English knights who were sent
to command and govern this kingdom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One extortionate Irish custom, called
&ldquo;coigny,&rdquo; they specially affected, of which
it was said &ldquo;that though it were first
invented in hell, yet if it had been used
and practised there as it hath been in Ireland,
it had long since destroyed the very
kingdom of Beelzebub.&rdquo;</p>

<p>England and Wales were more fortunate.
In England&mdash;while the old English literature
was crushed out by the heel of the
oppressor, the Norman instinct seized on
the latent possibilities of the old English
political institutions, welded them into a
great system, developed out of them
representative government, and created a
united nation.</p>

<p>In Wales, the Normans paid little or no
heed to Welsh laws and political institutions;
the law of the Marches was the
feudal law of France, the charters of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg&nbsp;32]</a></span>
liberties of the towns were imported from
Normandy; the Welsh Marches and
border shires were the most thoroughly
Normanised part of the whole kingdom.
But with a fine instinct for the really great
things, in Wales the Normans seized on
the literary side&mdash;the poetic traditions of
the people&mdash;giving them permanent form,
adding to them, making them for ever part
of the intellectual heritage of the whole
world.</p>

<p>It may very likely be a mere accident
that the earliest Welsh manuscripts date
from the twelfth-century&mdash;Norman times;
it may also imply an increased literary productiveness.
It may be due to accidental
causes that the first accounts of Eisteddfodau
extant date from the twelfth century;
it may also be that the institution excited
new interest, received new attention and
honour, under the influence of the open-minded
and keen-sighted invaders. Take,
for instance, the account of the great
Eisteddfod in 1176, from the Brut y
Tywysogion: &ldquo;The lord Rhys held a
grand festival at the castle of Aberteivi,
wherein he appointed two sorts of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg&nbsp;33]</a></span>
competitions&mdash;one between the bards and
poets, and the other between harpers,
fiddlers, pipers, and various performers of
instrumental music; and he assigned two
chairs for the victors in the competitions;
and these he enriched with vast gifts. A
young man of his own court, son to Cibon
the fiddler, obtained the victory in instrumental
music, and the men of Gwynedd
obtained the victory in vocal song; and
all the other minstrels obtained from the
lord Rhys as much as they asked for, so
that there was no one excluded.&rdquo; An
Eisteddfod where every one obtained
prizes, and every one was satisfied,
suggests the enthusiasm natural to a new
revival. It was now&mdash;when Wales was
brought in contact with the great world
through the Normans&mdash;that modern Welsh
poetry had its beginning. The new intellectual
impetus is clearly illustrated by the
change which takes place in the Welsh
chronicles about 1100. Before that time
they are generally thin and dreary: they
suddenly become full, lively, and romantic.
Wales was not exceptional in this
renaissance; something of the same sort
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg&nbsp;34]</a></span>
occurred in most parts of Europe; and the
renaissance is no doubt to be connected
with the Crusade, the reform of the Church,
in a word, with the Hildebrandine movement,
and so ultimately with the Burgundian
monastery of Clugny. But it was the
Normans who brought this new life to
England and Wales; the Normans were
the hands and feet of the great Hildebrandine
movement of which the Clugniac
popes were the head.</p>

<p>Among the Norman magnates who
encouraged the intellectual movement in
Wales&mdash;one stands out pre-eminent&mdash;Robert
Earl of Gloucester and Lord of Glamorgan,
a splendid combination of statesman,
soldier, patron of letters. Robert was
a natural son of Henry I.&mdash;born before
1100&mdash;there is no evidence that his
mother was the beautiful and famous Nest,
daughter of Rhys ap Tudor. He acquired
the Lordship of Glamorgan together with
the Honour of Gloucester and other lands
in England and Normandy, by marriage
with Mabel, daughter and heiress of Fitzhamon,
conqueror of Glamorgan. An
account of the wooing is preserved in old
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg&nbsp;35]</a></span>
rhymed chronicle: the king conducts
negotiations; the lady remarks that it
was not herself but her possessions he was
after&mdash;and she would prefer to marry a man
who had a surname. The account is not
historical, as surnames had not come in:
in the early twelfth century the lady would
have expressed her meaning differently.
However, there is evidence that she was a
good wife: William of Malmesbury says,
&ldquo;She was a noble and excellent woman,
devoted to her husband, and blest with a
numerous and beautiful family.&rdquo; Robert
was a great builder of castles; Bristol and
Cardiff Castles were his work, and many
others in Glamorgan; he organised
Glamorgan, giving it the constitution of
an English shire&mdash;with Cardiff Castle as
centre and meeting-place. After Henry
I.&rsquo;s death, he was the most important man
in England, and was the only prominent
man who played an honourable part in
the civil wars which are known as the
reign of Stephen; he died in 1147. His
relations with the Welsh appear to have
been good; large bodies of Welsh troops
fought under him at the battle of Lincoln,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg&nbsp;36]</a></span>
1141&mdash;he was probably the first Norman
lord of Glamorgan who could thus rely on
their loyalty. And it is significant that
in the earliest inquisitions extant for
Glamorgan&mdash;or inquests by sworn recognitors&mdash;Welshmen
were freely employed
in the work of local government.</p>

<p>Robert of Gloucester was a magnificent
patron of letters; to his age Giraldus
Cambrensis looked back with longing
regret as to the good old times in which
learning was recognised and received its
due reward. To Robert of Gloucester,
William of Malmesbury, the greatest
historian of the time, dedicated his history,
attributing to him the magnanimity of his
grandfather the Conqueror, the generosity
of his uncle, the wisdom of his father,
Henry I. He was the founder of Margam
Abbey, whose chronicle is one of the
authorities for Welsh history; Tewkesbury,
another abbey whose chronicle is preserved,
counted him among its chief
benefactors; Robert de Monte, Abbot of
Mont St. Michel, the Breton and lover
of Breton legends, was a native of his
Norman estates at Torigny, and wrote a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg&nbsp;37]</a></span>
valuable history of his times. Among
the brilliant circle of men of letters who
frequented his court at Gloucester and
Bristol and Cardiff were Caradoc of
Llancarven, whose chronicle (if he ever
wrote one) has been lost, and greatest of
all Geoffrey of Monmouth.</p>

<p>Geoffrey dedicated his History of the
Kings of Britain to Robert: &ldquo;To you,
therefore, Robert Earl of Gloucester, this
work humbly sues for the favour of being
so corrected by your advice that it may be
considered not the poor offspring of
Geoffrey of Monmouth, but, when polished
by your refined wit and judgment, the
production of him who had Henry, the
glorious King of England, for his father,
and whom we see an accomplished scholar
and philosopher, as well as a brave soldier
and tried commander.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not very much is known about Geoffrey.
The so-called &ldquo;Gwentian Brut,&rdquo; attributed
to Caradoc of Llancarven, on which his
biographers have relied for a few details
of his life, is very untrustworthy, and,
according to the late Mr. Thomas Stephens,
was written about the middle of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg&nbsp;38]</a></span>
sixteenth century, though containing earlier
matter. The sixteenth century was a
great age for historical forgeries. We
find a Franciscan interpolating passages
in a Greek manuscript of the New Testament
in order to refute Erasmus; a learned
Oxonian forging a passage in the manuscript
of Asser&rsquo;s &ldquo;Life of Alfred&rdquo; to prove
that Alfred founded the University of
Oxford; and Welsh genealogies invented
by the dozen and the yard&mdash;reaching back
to &ldquo;son of Adam, son of God.&rdquo; The
&ldquo;Gwentian Brut&rdquo; or &ldquo;Book of Aberpergwm&rdquo;
is in doubtful company. The
following seem to be the facts known
about Geoffrey. In 1129 he was at
Oxford, in company with Walter, Archdeacon
of Oxford (not Walter Mapes).
His father&rsquo;s name was Arthur; and he
was connected with the Welsh lords of
Caerleon. He calls himself &ldquo;of Monmouth,&rdquo;
either as being born there, or
as having a connection with the Benedictine
monastery at Monmouth, which
was founded by a Breton, and kept up
connections with Brittany and Anjou.
He may have been archdeacon&mdash;but not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg&nbsp;39]</a></span>
of Monmouth. The first version of his
history was finished in or before April,
1139, and the final edition of the History
was completed by 1147. In his later
years he resided at Llandaff. He was
ordained priest in February, 1152, and
consecrated bishop of St. Asaph in the
same month. In 1153 he was one of the
witnesses to the compact between King
Stephen and Henry of Anjou, which
ended the civil wars. He died at Llandaff
in 1153.</p>

<p>We will now turn to consider the sources
of his History of the Kings of Britain.
Geoffrey says: &ldquo;In the course of many
and various studies I happened to light
on the history of the Kings of Britain,
and wondered that, in the account which
Gildas and Bede, in their elegant treatises,
had given of them, I found nothing said
of those kings who lived here before
Christ, nor of Arthur, and many others;
though their actions were celebrated by
many people in a pleasant manner, and
by heart, as if they had been written.
Whilst I was thinking of these things,
Walter, Archdeacon of Oxford, a man
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg&nbsp;40]</a></span>
learned in foreign histories, offered me a
very ancient book in the Britannic tongue,
which, in a continued regular story and
elegant style, related the actions of them
all, from Brutus down to Cadwallader.
At his request, therefore, I undertook the
translation of that book into Latin.&rdquo; At
the end of his history he adds: &ldquo;I leave
the history of the later kings of Wales to
Caradoc of Llancarven, my contemporary,
as I do also the kings of the Saxons to
William of Malmesbury and Henry of
Huntingdon. But I advise them to be
silent concerning the kings of the Britons,
since they have not that book written in
the Britannic tongue, which Walter,
Archdeacon of Oxford, brought out of
Britannia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There has been a good deal of controversy
as to whether this very ancient
book was in Welsh or Breton, but the
first question is, Did it ever exist? Was
Geoffrey a translator, or an inventor, or
a collector of oral traditions current in
Wales or Brittany during his time?</p>

<p>There can be little doubt that the conclusion
of Thomas Stephens, in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg&nbsp;41]</a></span>
&ldquo;Literature of the Kymry,&rdquo; is correct&mdash;that
&ldquo;Geoffrey was less a translator than
an original author.&rdquo; It is very doubtful
whether the Britannic book ever existed,
whether it was not a mere ruse, such as was
often resorted to by medi&aelig;val romancers,
and is still a favourite method with
modern historical novelists&mdash;to give their
works an appearance of genuineness. It
has been argued against this, that in that
case, Archdeacon Walter must have been
a party to the fraud&mdash;which is incredible.
Such an argument implies a large ignorance
of the archdeacons of the twelfth
century&mdash;when it was a question solemnly
discussed among the learned&mdash;whether
an archdeacon could possibly be saved.
It would be well if there were nothing
worse to bring against them than such
an innocent fraud on the public as this.
But the strongest argument against the
existence of the Britannic book is (not
that it is not extant now, but) that the
historians of the next generation never
saw it. Geoffrey&rsquo;s History at once created
a tremendous stir in the literary world&mdash;nor
was it accepted on trust&mdash;but received
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg&nbsp;42]</a></span>
with suspicion and incredulity. Thus
William of Newburgh, in the latter part of
the twelfth century, calls Geoffrey roundly,
&ldquo;a saucy and shameless liar.&rdquo; William, of
course, did not know Welsh, and could not
have made anything out of the Britannic
book, even if he had seen it. This objection
does not apply to Giraldus Cambrensis;
his knowledge of Welsh was indeed slight&mdash;but
he had plenty of Welsh-speaking
relatives and friends, and he was himself
a collector of manuscripts. Gerald refers
to &ldquo;the lying statements of Geoffrey&rsquo;s
fabulous history,&rdquo; and implies in a much-quoted
passage that he regarded Geoffrey&rsquo;s
history as a pack of lies. Speaking of a
Welshman at Caerleon who had dealings
with evil spirits, and was enabled by
their assistance to foretell future events, he
goes on: &ldquo;He knew when any one told
a lie in his presence, for he saw the devil
dancing on the tongue of the liar. If the
evil spirits oppressed him too much, the
Gospel of St. John was placed on his
bosom, when like birds they immediately
vanished; but when the Gospel was
removed, and the History of the Britons
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg&nbsp;43]</a></span>
by Geoffrey Arthur was substituted in its
place, the devils instantly came back in
greater numbers, and remained a longer
time than usual on his body and on
the book.&rdquo; Geoffrey may very probably
have used some Britannic manuscript, but
it could not have been very ancient; and
he certainly did not translate it, but
used it as he used Gildas and Bede
and Nennius&mdash;sometimes quoting their
statements, more generally amplifying
them almost beyond recognition.</p>

<p>Was Geoffrey merely an inventor?
Sometimes&mdash;undoubtedly. The long
strings of names of purely fictitious princes
whom the Roman Consul summoned to
fight against King Arthur, at a time
when in sober history Justinian was
Roman Emperor, are invented by Geoffrey.
And consider too his parodies of the
practice of historians of referring to
contemporary events: an instance of the
genuine article is given in Gerald&rsquo;s
Itinerary. &ldquo;In 1188, Urban III. being
pope, Frederick, Emperor of the Romans,
Isaac, Emperor of Constantinople, Philip,
King of France,&rdquo; &amp;c., &amp;c. Now take
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg&nbsp;44]</a></span>
Geoffrey&rsquo;s parodies: &ldquo;At this time, Samuel
the prophet governed in Jud&aelig;a, &AElig;neas was
living, and Homer was esteemed a famous
orator and poet.&rdquo; Or again: &ldquo;At the
building of Shaftesbury an eagle spoke
while the wall of the town was being
built: and indeed I should have transmitted
the speech to posterity, had I
thought it true, like the rest of the history.
At this time Haggai, Amos, Joel, and
Azariah were prophets of Israel.&rdquo; One
may be quite sure that passages like these
are not derived from the writings of the
ancients, or from oral traditions. One
can in some cases trace back his statements
and see how much he added to
his predecessors. A good instance is
his account of the conversion of the
Britons under King Lucius, in Bk. IV.,
cap. 19 and 20, and V., cap. 1 (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 161).
Geoffrey&rsquo;s account is circumstantial: King
Lucius sent to the Pope asking for
instruction in the Christian religion.
The Pope sent two teachers (whose names
are given), who almost extinguished
paganism over the whole island, dedicated
the heathen temples to the true God, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg&nbsp;45]</a></span>
substituted three archbishops for the three
heathen archflamens at London, York,
and Caerleon-on-Usk, and twenty-eight
bishops for the twenty-eight heathen
flamens. Now all this is based on a short
passage in Bede: &ldquo;Lucius King of the
Britains sent to the Pope asking that he
might be made a Christian; he soon
obtained his desire, and the Britons kept
the faith pure till the Diocletian persecution,&rdquo;
which itself is amplified from an
entry in the <i>Liber Pontificalis</i>: &ldquo;Lucius
King of the Britains sent to the Pope
asking that he might be made a Christian.&rdquo;
This last does not occur in the early version
of the <i>Liber Pontificalis</i>, and is irreconcilable
with the history and position of the
papacy in the second century; but is a
forgery, inserted at the end of the seventh
century by the Romanising party in the
Welsh Church&mdash;the party desiring to
bring the Welsh Church into communion
with the Roman, and so interested in
proving that British Christianity came
direct from the Pope; and all the talk
about the archflamens and archbishops,
&amp;c., is pure invention. Notice too what
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg&nbsp;46]</a></span>
an important part the places with which
Geoffrey is specially connected play in
his history: Caerleon is the seat of an
archbishopric and favourite residence of
Arthur; Oxford is frequently mentioned
though it did not exist until the end of
the ninth century; the Consul of Gloucester
(predecessor of Geoffrey&rsquo;s patron, Robert,
Consul of Gloucester) makes the decisive
move in Arthur&rsquo;s battle with the Romans.</p>

<p>A parallel case is Geoffrey&rsquo;s account of
Brutus and the descent of the Britons
from the Trojans. The tradition is found
in Nennius, and perhaps dates from the
classical revival at the court of Charlemagne.
It is clearly not a popular
tradition, but an artificial tradition of the
learned; but whilst Geoffrey did not
invent the legend, he invented all the
details&mdash;letters and speeches, and hairbreadth
escapes and tales of love and war.</p>

<p>Probably his detailed accounts of King
Arthur&rsquo;s European conquests&mdash;extending
over nearly all Western Europe, from
Iceland and Norway to Gaul and Italy&mdash;are
still more the work of Geoffrey&rsquo;s
inventive genius, though it is possible
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg&nbsp;47]</a></span>
they may rest on early Celtic myths
about the voyage of Arthur to Hades,
as Professor Rhys suggests, or on late
Breton traditions which mixed up Arthur
with Charles the Great.</p>

<p>Now let us consider Geoffrey as a
gatherer and transmitter of the genuine
oral traditions of the Welsh and Breton
people. Genuine traditions are true history
in the sense that they preserve manners
and customs and modes of thought prevalent
at the time when they became
current. Thus they are on quite a
different level from Geoffrey&rsquo;s inventions,
though they cannot be taken as containing
the history of any of the individuals to
whom they profess to relate. He tells us
in his preface that the actions of Arthur
and many others, though not mentioned
by historians, &ldquo;were celebrated by many
people in a pleasant manner and by
heart,&rdquo; were sung by poets and handed
down from generation to generation, like
the poetical traditions of every people in
primitive times. There can be no doubt
that Geoffrey collected a number of these
old stories and wove them into his narrative.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg&nbsp;48]</a></span>
Thus, the story of King Lear and his
daughters has the ring of a genuine popular
tradition about it, though the dates and
pseudo-historical setting were probably
supplied by Geoffrey. Again, there were
certainly prophecies attributed to Merlin
current in Geoffrey&rsquo;s time. But one may
suspect Geoffrey of doing a good deal more
than translate the prophecies of Merlin;
he adapted them; one may even suspect
him of parodying them. &ldquo;After him shall
succeed the boar of Totness, and oppress
the people with grievous tyranny. Gloucester
shall send forth a lion and shall
disturb him in his cruelty in several battles.
The lion shall trample him under his feet
... and at last get upon the backs of the
nobility. A bull shall come into the
quarrel and strike the lion ... but shall
break his horns against the walls of Oxford.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Then shall two successively sway
the sceptre, whom a horned dragon shall
serve. One shall come in armour and
ride upon a flying serpent. He shall sit
upon its back with his naked body, and
cast his right hand upon its tail.... The
second shall ally with the lion; but a
quarrel happening they shall encounter one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg&nbsp;49]</a></span>
another ... but the courage of the beast
shall prevail. Then shall one come with
a drum, and appease the rage of the lion.
Therefore shall the people of the kingdom
be at peace, and provoke the lion to a dose
of physic!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then as to Arthur. In Geoffrey&rsquo;s history
he appears mainly as a great continental
conqueror&mdash;a kind of Welsh Charlemagne.
&ldquo;Many of the most picturesque and significant
features of the full-grown legend
(as Professor Lewis Jones points out)<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> are
not even faintly suggested by Geoffrey.
The Round Table, Lancelot, the Grail
were unknown to him, and were grafted
on the legend from other sources.&rdquo; But
he made the Arthurian legends fashionable;
he opened for all Europe the hitherto
unknown and inexhaustible well of Celtic
romance; and it may be said without
exaggeration that &ldquo;no medi&aelig;val work has
left behind it so prolific a literary offspring
as the History of the Kings of Britain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The value of Geoffrey is not in his
fictions about past history, but in his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg&nbsp;50]</a></span>
influence on the literature and ideas of the
future. He stands at the beginning of a
new age: he is the first spokesman of the
Age of the new Chivalry. Read his
glowing account of Arthur&rsquo;s court, where
&ldquo;the knights were famous for feats of
chivalry, and the women esteemed none
worthy of their love but such as had given
proof of their valour in three several
battles. Thus was the valour of the men
an encouragement for the women&rsquo;s chastity,
and the love of the women a spur to the
knight&rsquo;s bravery.&rdquo; Or, as an old French
version has it, &ldquo;Love which made the
women more chaste made the knights more
valorous and famous.&rdquo; We have here a
new conception of love which has profoundly
influenced life and thought ever
since&mdash;love no longer a weakness as in
the ancient world, or a sin as it seemed to
the ascetic spirit of the Church, but a
conscious source of strength, an avowed
motive of heroism. And it was round
Arthur and his court that the French
poets of the next generation wove their
romances inspired by this conception&mdash;the
offspring of the union of Norman strength
and Celtic gentleness.</p>

<h2>III</h2>

<h3>GIRALDUS CAMBRENSIS</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">G</span>ERALD the Welshman was certainly
one of the most remarkable
men of letters that the Middle Ages produced&mdash;remarkable
not merely for the
great range of his knowledge, or the
voluminousness of his writings, but for
the originality of his views and variety of
his interests.</p>

<p>In this lecture I intend to give first a
general account of his life, and then deal
in more detail with his Itinerary through
Wales.</p>

<p>We know a great deal about Gerald; he
was interested in many things, and not
least in himself; he was not troubled by
that shrinking sense of his own worthlessness&mdash;with
the feeling of being not an
individual, but a part of a community&mdash;which
is so characteristic of medi&aelig;val
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg&nbsp;54]</a></span>
writers, and led them often to omit to
mention their own names.</p>

<p>Gerald was born about 1146, at Manorbier,
in Pembroke&mdash;&ldquo;the most delightful
spot in Wales.&rdquo; His ancestry is interesting.
His father was a Norman noble,
holding of Glamorgan, William de Barri
by name; his mother was the daughter of
another Norman noble, Gerald de Windsor
of Pembroke, and the famous Nest, daughter
of Rhys ap Tudor, the Helen of Wales. He
was cousin of the Fitzgeralds who played
so important a part in the conquest of
Ireland, and connected with Richard
Strongbow and the great house of Clare.
He thus &ldquo;moved in the highest circles,&rdquo;
and lived in an atmosphere of great deeds
and great traditions.</p>

<p>He was from the first marked out by his
own inclinations for an ecclesiastical career.
He tells us that when he and his elder
brothers used to play as children on the
sands of Manorbier his brothers built
castles but he always built churches. He
received an elementary education from the
chaplains of his uncle, the Bishop of St.
David&rsquo;s; he seems to have been slow at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg&nbsp;55]</a></span>
learning when a child, and his tutors
goaded him on not by the birch rod, but
by sarcasm&mdash;by declining &ldquo;<i>Stultus</i>, <i>stultior</i>,
<i>stultissimus</i>.&rdquo; His higher education was
not obtained in Wales, and it is singular
that he does not notice any place of learning
in Wales in all his writings. He studied at
Gloucester, and then at Paris, the greatest
medi&aelig;val university. We have it on his
own authority that he was a model student.
&ldquo;So entirely devoted was he to study,
having in his acts and in his mind, no sort
of levity or coarseness, that whenever the
Masters of Arts wished to select a pattern
from among the good scholars, they would
name Gerald before all others.&rdquo; Later he
lectured at Paris on canon law and theology;
his lectures, he tells us, were very
popular. He returned thence in 1172, two
years after the martyrdom of Thomas
Becket, whose example and struggle for
the rights of the Church made a deep and
lasting impression on him. Gerald soon
obtained preferment: he held three livings
in Pembroke, one in Oxfordshire, and
canonries at Hereford and St. David&rsquo;s.
His energy soon made itself felt. He
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg&nbsp;56]</a></span>
excommunicated the Welshmen and Flemings
who would not pay tithes; and then
attacked the sins of the clergy. Most of
the Welsh clergy were married, contrary
to the laws of the Church. Gerald hated
a married priest even more than he hated
a monk. The Welsh priest, he says, was
wont to keep in his house a female (<i>focaria</i>)
&ldquo;to light his fire but extinguish his virtue.&rdquo;
&ldquo;How can such a man practice frugality
and self-denial with a house full of
brawling brats, and a woman for ever
extracting money to buy costly robes
with long skirts trailing in the dust?&rdquo;
Gerald hated women&mdash;the origin of all
evil since the world began: observing that
in birds of prey the females are stronger
than the males, he remarks that this
signifies &ldquo;the female sex is more resolute
in all evil than the male.&rdquo; Among the
married clergy he attacked was the Archdeacon
of Brecon; and the old man, being
forced to choose between his wife and his
archdeaconry, preferred his wife. Gerald
was made Archdeacon of Brecon. In later
years he had qualms of conscience about
the part he took in this business.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg&nbsp;57]</a></span>
Between 1180 and 1194 he was often at
Court and employed in the king&rsquo;s affairs.
Henry II. selected him as a suitable person
to accompany the young prince John to
Ireland in 1185, and the result was his two
great works&mdash;&ldquo;The Topography,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;The Conquest of Ireland,&rdquo; which are the
chief and almost the only authorities for
Irish history in the Middle Ages. The
former work he read publicly at Oxford on
his return; it was a great occasion: we
must tell it in his own words. &ldquo;When the
work was finished, not wishing to hide his
candle under a bushel, but wishing to place
it in a candlestick, so that it might give
light, he resolved to read it before a vast
audience at Oxford, where scholars in
England chiefly flourished and excelled in
scholarship. And as there were three
divisions in the work, and each division
occupied a day, the readings lasted three
successive days. On the first day, he
received and entertained at his lodgings all
the poor people of the town; on the second,
all the doctors of the different faculties and
their best students; and on the third, the
rest of the students and the chief men of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg&nbsp;58]</a></span>
the town. It was a costly and noble act;
and neither present nor past time can
furnish any record of such a solemnity
having ever taken place in England.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In 1188 he accompanied the Archbishop
of Canterbury in his tour through Wales to
preach the Third Crusade. With this we
shall deal later.</p>

<p>He was abroad with Henry II. at the
time of the old king&rsquo;s death, and has left a
valuable account of his later years in the
book &ldquo;On the Instruction of Princes.&rdquo;
His connection with the Court gave him
opportunities for studying the great characters
of the time at close quarters, and
we have from his pen graphic sketches of
many of them. Take this description of
Henry II.: &ldquo;He had a reddish complexion,
rather dark, and a large round head. His
eyes were gray, bloodshot, and flashed in
anger. He had a fiery face; his voice was
shaky; he had a deep chest, and long
muscular arms, his great round head hanging
somewhat forward. He had an enormous
belly&mdash;though not from gross feeding.
Indeed he was temperate in all things, for
a prince. To keep down his corpulency,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg&nbsp;59]</a></span>
he took immoderate exercise. Even in
times of peace he took no rest&mdash;hunting
furiously all day, and on his return home in
the evening seldom sitting down either
before or after supper; for in spite of his
own fatigue, he would weary out the Court
by being constantly on his legs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The whole is very interesting and full of
life. It occurs in the &ldquo;Conquest of Ireland,&rdquo;
and is quoted in several of his other works.
Gerald&rsquo;s favourite author was Gerald of
Barry, Archdeacon of Brecon.</p>

<p>The next important episode in his life
was the struggle for St. David&rsquo;s (1198-1203).
It was really a fight for the
independence of the Welsh Church from
England and its direct dependence on
the Pope. Gerald was elected bishop by
the canons of St. David&rsquo;s, in opposition
to the will of King John (whose consent
was necessary) and of Hubert Walter,
Archbishop of Canterbury (whose rights
as metropolitan were attacked). Gerald
hastened off to Rome to get the Pope&rsquo;s
support, taking with him the most
precious offering that he could think of&mdash;six
of his own books; for Rome had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg&nbsp;60]</a></span>
a bad name for bribery&mdash;and who could
resist such a bribe? But he found it
advisable to supplement his books by
other promises, especially by the offer to
the Pope of tithes from Wales.</p>

<p>The Pope at this time was Innocent III.&mdash;the
greatest of all the Popes&mdash;who
brought kings and nations under his feet
and held despotic sway over the Universal
Church, and stamped out heresy in blood.
In the references to him in Gerald&rsquo;s works
he appears in much more human guise.
We see him after supper unbending and
laughing at Gerald&rsquo;s anecdotes and cracking
jokes of a somewhat risky character
with the archdeacon. It is clear that the
Pope thoroughly enjoyed the Welshman&rsquo;s
company, but also that he did not take
him very seriously as an ecclesiastical
statesman. &ldquo;Let us have some more
stories about your archbishop&rsquo;s bad
Latin,&rdquo; he would say, when Gerald was
getting too urgent on the independence
of the Welsh Church or his own right
to the see of St. David&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>This archbishop was Hubert Walter,
who was much more of a secular administrator
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg&nbsp;61]</a></span>
than an ecclesiastic, and whose Latin
though clear and ready might show a
fine contempt for all rules of grammar.
Gerald was a stickler for correct Latin
grammar; he is great on &ldquo;howlers.&rdquo; There
is one of his stories, illustrating both the
avarice of the Norman prelates and the
ignorance of the Welsh clergy: A Welsh
priest came to his bishop and said, &ldquo;I
have brought your lordship a present of
two hundred <i>oves</i>.&rdquo; He meant &ldquo;<i>ova</i>&rdquo;;
but the bishop insisted on the sheep; and
the priest probably rubbed up his Latin
grammar. Gerald had also other patriotic
reasons for his hostility to the archbishop,
who as chief justiciary&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, chief minister
of the king&mdash;had recently attacked
and defeated the Welsh between the
Wye and the Severn. &ldquo;Blessed be
God,&rdquo; writes Gerald sarcastically to him,
&ldquo;who has taught your hands to war and
your fingers to fight, for since the days
when Harold almost exterminated the
nation, no prince has destroyed so many
Welshmen in one battle as your Grace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gerald continued the struggle till 1203,
though deserted by the Welsh clergy.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg&nbsp;62]</a></span>
&ldquo;The laity of Wales,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;stood by
me; but of the clergy whose battle I was
fighting, scarce one.&rdquo; He was proclaimed
as a rebel, and had some narrow escapes
of imprisonment or worse&mdash;escapes which
he owed to his ready wit and which he
delights to tell. At last he gave way,
and during the remainder of his life we
find him at Rome, Lincoln, St. David&rsquo;s,
revising his works and writing new
ones, modifying some of his judgments
(especially that on Hubert Walter), and
encouraging Stephen Langton in the
great struggle against John. He was
buried at St. David&rsquo;s, probably in 1223.</p>

<p>We will now return to the &ldquo;Itinerary
through Wales&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Description of
Wales.&rdquo; Jerusalem was taken by Saladin
in 1187, and the Third Crusade&mdash;the
Crusade of Richard C&oelig;ur de Lion&mdash;was
preached throughout Europe. In 1188
Archbishop Baldwin made a preaching
tour through Wales accompanied by Glanville,
the great justiciary of Henry II.,
and Gerald of Barry. While the primary
object was the preaching of the Crusade,
the king had an eye to business and saw
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg&nbsp;63]</a></span>
that the Holy Cause could be utilised for
other purposes; it gave an opportunity
for the assertion of the metropolitan rights
of Canterbury over the Welsh Church,
and for a survey of the country by the
royal officials, which was not possible
under other circumstances. That is why
the archbishop and the justiciar accompanied
the expedition. It is remarkable
that Gerald, the champion of the Welsh
Church, should have given his support to
it; but he had not fully adopted the
patriotic attitude of his later years; and,
with him as with most people of the time,
the rescue of the Holy Sepulchre was, in
theory at any rate, the greatest object in
the world; while further, we must not
forget that the journey had many attractions
for him as an author; it gave him
&ldquo;copy&rdquo; for a new book, and the chance
of reading his Irish Topography to the
archbishop. Every day during the
journey the archbishop listened to a
portion of this book, and at the end
took it home to finish. As the journey
lasted at least fifty days, one may calculate
that it took at most an average of three
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg&nbsp;64]</a></span>
pages a day to send the archbishop to
sleep.</p>

<p>The Itinerary (which was later dedicated
to Stephen Langton) contains in the
author&rsquo;s words an account of &ldquo;the difficult
places through which we passed, the
names of springs and torrents, the witty
sayings, the toils and incidents of the
journey, the memorable events of ancient
and modern times, and the natural history
and description of the country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The route pursued was as follows:
From Hereford to Radnor, Brecon, Abergavenny,
Caerleon, Newport, Cardiff,
Llandaff, Ewenny, Margam, Swansea,
Kidweli, Carmarthen, Haverford, St.
David&rsquo;s, Cardigan, Strata Florida, thence
keeping close to the coast, through Bangor
and Chester; and then south by Oswestry,
Shrewsbury, Ludlow, to Hereford.</p>

<p>The travellers were well received and
entertained both by the Lords Marcher
and the Welsh princes. It was especially
to the Welsh that their attention was
directed, and Welsh princes accompanied
them through their territories. The chief
was Rhys ap Gruffydd (Gerald&rsquo;s uncle),
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg&nbsp;65]</a></span>
prince of South Wales, who was then at
the height of his power, and had been made
chief justice of South Wales by Henry II.,
to whom he faithfully adhered. Gwynedd
and Powys were then divided among
several heirs. One of the princes of
Powys, Owain Cyfeiliog, the poet, was
distinguished as being the only prince
who did not come to meet the archbishop
with his people; for which he was excommunicated.
Gerald notes that he was an
adherent of Henry II., and was &ldquo;conspicuous
for the good management of his
territory.&rdquo; Perhaps that is why he would
not have anything to do with the Crusade.</p>

<p>How far was the expedition successful
in its primary object in gaining crusaders?
The archbishop and justiciar had already
taken the cross; they remained true to
their vows and went to the Holy Land,
the archbishop dying at the siege of
Acre, heartbroken at the wickedness of
the army. Gerald himself was the first
to take the cross in Wales, not acting
under the influence of religious enthusiasm,
but (as he says himself) &ldquo;impelled by the
urgent requests and promises of the king
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg&nbsp;66]</a></span>
and persuasions of the archbishop,&rdquo; who
wanted him to act as historian; but
Gerald, after setting the example, bought
a dispensation and did not go. A number
of the lesser Welsh princes soon took the
cross. The Lord Rhys himself was eager
to do so, but &ldquo;his wife by female artifices
diverted him wholly from his noble purpose.&rdquo;
The wives were all dead against
the whole affair. At Hay the wives caught
hold of their husbands, and the would-be
Crusaders had literally to run away from
them to the castle, leaving their cloaks
behind them. A nobler spirit of self-sacrifice
was shown by the old woman of
Cardigan, who, when her only son took
the cross, said: &ldquo;O most beloved Lord
Jesus Christ, I give Thee hearty thanks
for having conferred on me the blessing of
bringing forth a son worthy of Thy service.&rdquo;
This son was probably worth more than the
twelve archers of the castle of St. Clears
who were forcibly signed with the cross
for committing a murder; and one may
reasonably look with suspicion on the
sudden conversion of &ldquo;many of the most
notorious murderers and robbers of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg&nbsp;67]</a></span>
neighbourhood&rdquo; at Usk. It was this
kind of thing that turned the Holy Land
into a sort of convict settlement.</p>

<p>The preachers clearly worked hard and
had some trying experiences, and kept up
their spirits by little jokes, which Gerald
retails. They nearly came to grief in
quicksands at the mouth of the river
Neath. &ldquo;Terrible hard country this,&rdquo; said
one of the monks next day in the castle
at Swansea. &ldquo;Some people are never
satisfied,&rdquo; retorted his companion; &ldquo;you
were complaining of its being too soft in
the quicksand yesterday.&rdquo; The mountains
were trying to men no longer in their
youth; after toiling up one the archbishop
sank exhausted on a fallen tree and said
to his panting companions, &ldquo;Can any one
enliven the company by whistling a
tune?&rdquo; &ldquo;Which,&rdquo; adds Gerald, &ldquo;is not
very easily done by people out of breath.&rdquo;
From whistling the conversation passed
to nightingales, which some one said were
never found in Wales. &ldquo;Wise bird, the
nightingale,&rdquo; remarked the archbishop.</p>

<p>One serious difficulty they had was that
none of them, not even Gerald, knew
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg&nbsp;68]</a></span>
Welsh sufficiently well to preach in it,
though they generally had interpreters.
The archbishop, who would sometimes
preach away for hours without result,
felt this much more than Gerald. He
declares he moved crowds to tears though
they did not understand a word of what he
was saying. But one may take the words
of Prince Rhys&rsquo;s fool as evidence (if any
were needed) that ignorance of Welsh
weakened the effect. &ldquo;You owe a great
debt, Rhys, to your kinsman the archdeacon,
who has taken a hundred or so
of your men to serve the Lord; if he had
only spoken in Welsh, you wouldn&rsquo;t have
had a soul left.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In all about three thousand took the
cross; but the Crusade was delayed, zeal
cooled, and it is probable that comparatively
few went. The <i>Itinerarium Regis
Ricardi</i> mentions, I think, only one exploit
by a Welshman in the Third Crusade;
he was an archer, and so a South Walian.</p>

<p>This brings me to one of the incidental
notes of great value scattered about the
Itinerary. Speaking of the siege of
Abergavenny (1182), Gerald tells us that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg&nbsp;69]</a></span>
the men of Gwent and Glamorgan
excelled all others in the use of the
bow, and gives curious evidence of the
strength of their shooting. Thus the
arrows pierced an oak door four inches
thick; they had been left there as a
curiosity, and Gerald saw them with their
iron points coming through on the inner
side. He describes these bows as &ldquo;made
of elm&mdash;ugly, unfinished-looking weapons,
but astonishingly stiff, large, and strong,
and equally useful for long and short
shooting.&rdquo; Add to this that the longbow
was not a characteristic English weapon
till the latter part of the thirteenth century,
that the first battle in which an English
king made effective use of archery (at
Falkirk, 1298), his infantry consisted
mainly of Welshmen; and there can be
little doubt that the famous longbow of
England, which won the victories of Cre&ccedil;y
and Poitiers and Agincourt, and indirectly
did much to destroy feudalism and villenage,
had its home in South Wales.</p>

<p>Gerald was also a keen observer of
nature, and his knowledge of the ways of
animals is extensive and peculiar. Perhaps
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg&nbsp;70]</a></span>
even more marked is his love of the
supernatural; he could believe anything,
if it was only wonderful enough&mdash;except
Geoffrey of Monmouth&rsquo;s History. But
I must confine myself to one story&mdash;the
story of the boy in Gower who (as the root
of learning is bitter) played truant and
found two little men of pigmy stature, and
went with them to their country under the
earth, and played games with golden balls
with the fairy prince. These little folk
were very small&mdash;of fair complexion, and
long luxuriant hair; and they had horses
and dogs to suit their size. They hated
nothing so much as lies; &ldquo;they had no
form of public worship, being lovers and
reverers, it seemed, of truth.&rdquo; The boy
often went, till he tried to steal a golden
ball, and then he could never find fairyland
again. But he learnt some of the fairy
language, which was like Greek. And
then Gerald compares words in different
languages, and notes how, for instance, the
same word for <em>salt</em> runs through Greek and
British and Irish and Latin and French
and English and German, and the fairy
language, which suggests a close relation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg&nbsp;71]</a></span>
between all these peoples in past ages. It
is very modern; and it is not without
reason that Gerald has been called &ldquo;the
father of comparative philology.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In his &ldquo;Description of Wales&rdquo; Gerald
describes the manner of life and characteristics
of the people. All are trained
to arms, and when the trumpet sounds the
alarm, the husbandman rushes as eagerly
from his plough as the courtier from his
court. Agricultural work takes up little
of their time, as they are still mainly in a
pastoral stage, living on the produce of
their herds, and eating more meat than
bread. They fight and undergo hardships
and willingly sacrifice their lives for their
country and for liberty. They wear little
defensive armour, and depend mainly on
their mobility; they are not much good at
a close engagement, but generally victors
in a running fight, relying more on their
activity than on their strength.</p>

<p>It was the fashion to keep open house
for all comers. &ldquo;Those who arrive in the
morning are entertained till evening with
the conversation of young women and the
music of the harp; for each house has its
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg&nbsp;72]</a></span>
young women and harps allotted for the
purpose. In each family the art of playing
on the harp is held preferable to any other
learning; and no nation is so free from
jealousy as the Welsh.&rdquo; After a simple
supper (for the people are not addicted to
gluttony or drunkenness), &ldquo;a bed of rushes
is placed along the side of the hall, and all
in common lie down to sleep with their
feet towards the fire. They sleep in the
thin cloak and tunic they wear by day.
They receive much comfort from the
natural heat of the persons lying near
them; but when the underside begins to
be tired with the hardness of the bed, or
the upper one to suffer from the cold, they
get up and go to the fire; and then
returning to the couch they expose their
sides alternately to the cold and to the
hardness of the bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gifted with an acute and rich intellect
they excel in whatever studies they pursue,
notably in music. They are especially
famous for their part-singing, &ldquo;so that in
a company of singers, which one very
often meets with in Wales, you will hear
as many different parts and voices as there
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg&nbsp;73]</a></span>
are performers,&rdquo;(!) and this gift has by long
habit become natural to the nation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They show a greater respect than
other nations to churches and ecclesiastics,
to the relics of saints, bells, holy books,
and the cross; and hence their churches
enjoy more than common tranquillity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He then goes on to the other side of
the picture: &ldquo;for history without truth
becomes undeserving of its name.&rdquo; &ldquo;These
people are no less light in mind than in
body, and by no means to be relied on.
They are easily urged to undertake any
action, and as easily checked from prosecuting
it.... They never scruple at
taking a false oath for the sake of any
temporary advantage.... Above all
other peoples they are given to removing
their neighbours&rsquo; landmarks. Hence arise
quarrels, murders, conflagrations, and
frequent fratricides. It is remarkable that
brothers show more affection to each other
when dead than when living; for they
persecute the living even unto death, but
avenge the dead with all their power.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Finally, as a scientific observer of politics,
he discusses how Wales may be conquered
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg&nbsp;74]</a></span>
and governed, and how the Welsh may
resist.</p>

<p>A prince who would subdue this people
must give his whole energies to the task
for at least a whole year. He must divide
their strength, and by bribes and promises
endeavour to stir up one against the other,
knowing the spirit of hatred and envy
which generally prevails among them.
He must cut off supplies, build castles, and
use light-armed troops and plenty of them;
for though many English mercenaries perish
in a battle, money will procure as many
more; but to the Welsh the loss is for the
time irreparable. He recommends that all
the English inhabitants of the Marches
should be trained to arms; for the Welsh
fight for liberty and only a free people
can subdue them. His advice to the
Welsh is: Unite. &ldquo;If they would be
inseparable, they would be insuperable,
being assisted by these three circumstances&mdash;a
country well defended by nature,
a people contented to live upon little, a
community whose nobles and commoners
alike are trained in the use of arms; and
especially as the English fight for power,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg&nbsp;75]</a></span>
the Welsh for liberty; the English hirelings
for money, the Welsh patriots for
their country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I hope I may persuade some who do
not yet know Gerald to make his acquaintance,
and to read either his works on
Ireland and Wales, translated in Bohn&rsquo;s
library, or Mr. Henry Owen&rsquo;s brilliant
and delightful volume, &ldquo;Gerald the
Welshman,&rdquo; my indebtedness to which
I wish to acknowledge. Gerald tells us
many miracles; but he has himself performed
a miracle as wonderful as any he
relates; he has kept all the charm and
freshness of youth for more than seven
hundred years.</p>

<h2>IV</h2>

<h3>CASTLES</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>ALES is pre-eminently the land
of castles. There are between
thirty and forty in Glamorgan alone.
The accompanying map, though it is by
no means exhaustive, shows the general
lie of the castles, which may be divided
into three groups, having as their respective
bases Chester, Shrewsbury, and Gloucester.
But though there is some evidence of an
organised plan for the conquest of Wales
in the time of William Rufus, it is useless
to look for any great and general system
of offence or defence, because most of the
castles were not built by a centralised
government with any such object in view,
but by individuals to guard their own
territories and protect their independence
against either their neighbours or the
English king. The great age of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg&nbsp;80]</a></span>
castle-building was between 1100 and 1300.
Castles play a very small part in the
fighting in Wales till the end of the eleventh
century. Before that time indeed there
were few stone castles anywhere; the
usual type, even of the early Norman
castles, was a moated mound surrounded
by wooden palisades. One hears for
instance of a castle being built by William
the Conqueror in eight days. An example
of this early type of fortress was Pembroke
Castle at the end of the eleventh century,
&ldquo;a slender fortress of stakes and turf,&rdquo;
which had the good fortune to be in
charge of Gerald of Windsor, grandfather
of Giraldus Cambrensis. It stood several
sieges, which shows that the siege engines
of the Welsh were of a very poor and
primitive type. One of these sieges was
turned into a blockade, and the garrison
was nearly reduced by starvation. The
constable had recourse to a time-honoured
ruse. &ldquo;With great prudence he caused
four hogs which still remained to be cut
into small pieces and thrown down among
the enemy. The next day he had recourse
to a more refined stratagem: he contrived
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg&nbsp;81]</a></span>
that a letter from him should fall into the
hands of the enemy stating that there was
no need for assistance for the next four
months.&rdquo; The besiegers were taken in
and dispersed to their homes.</p>

<p>The characteristic types of castles in the
twelfth century were the rectangular keep
and the shell keep; in the thirteenth the
concentric castle. Of the two last we have
splendid examples in Cardiff and Caerphilly.
Of rectangular keeps there are very few in
Wales&mdash;Chepstow is the only important
one&mdash;though there are several on the
borders, notably Ludlow. The square
keep seems to us most characteristic of
Norman military architecture; the Tower
of London, Rochester, Newcastle, Castle
Rising, are well-known examples, and there
are many more in a good state of preservation;
there are many more solid square
keeps than shell keeps well preserved, but
this is simply due to the greater solidity
of the former; the shell keeps were far
more numerous in the twelfth century;
and the reasons for this are obvious&mdash;the
rectangular keep was much more expensive
to build, and it was too heavy to erect on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg&nbsp;82]</a></span>
the artificial mounds on which the Norman
architects generally founded their castles.</p>

<p>The keep of Cardiff Castle is one of the
most perfect shell keeps in existence. It
is built on a round artificial mound, surrounded
by a wide and deep moat&mdash;the
mound and moat being, of course, complements
of each other. Such mounds and
moats are common in all parts of England,
and in Normandy. They are not Roman,
nor British, nor are they, as Mr. G.&nbsp;T.
Clark maintained, characteristic of Anglo-Saxon
work. They are essentially Norman,
and a good representation of the
making of such a mound may be seen in
the Bayeux Tapestry, under the heading&mdash;&lsquo;He
orders them to dig a castle.&rsquo; When
was the Cardiff mound made? Perhaps
the short entry in the Brut gives the
answer: &ldquo;1080, the building of Cardiff
began.&rdquo; It would then be surrounded by
wooden palisades, and surmounted by a
timber structure, as a newly made mound
would not stand the masonry. The shell
keep was probably built by Robert of
Gloucester, and it was probably in the
gate-house of this keep, that Robert of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg&nbsp;83]</a></span>
Normandy was imprisoned. A shell keep
was a ring wall eight or ten feet thick,
about thirty feet high, not covered in, and
enclosing an open courtyard, round which
were placed the buildings&mdash;light structures,
often wooden sheds, abutting on the ring
wall&mdash;such as one may see now in the
courtyard of Castell Coch. The shell keep
was the centre of Robert&rsquo;s castle, but not
the whole. From this time dated the
great outer walls on the south and west&mdash;walls
forty feet high and ten feet thick
and solid throughout. The north and
east and part of the south sides of the castle
precincts are enclosed by banks of earth,
beneath which, the walls of a Roman camp
have recently been discovered. These
banks were capped by a slight embattled
wall. Outside along the north, south and
east fronts was a moat, formerly fed
by the Taff through the Mill leat stream
which ran along the west front. The
present lodgings, or habitable part of the
castle built on either side of the great west
wall, date mostly from the fifteenth century.
The earlier lodgings were, perhaps, on the
same site&mdash;though only inside the wall; a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg&nbsp;84]</a></span>
great lord did not as a rule live in the
keep, except in times of danger.</p>

<p>The area of the enclosure is about ten
acres&mdash;more suited to a Roman garrison
than to a lord marcher of the twelfth
century. That the castle was difficult to
guard is shown by the success of Ivor
Bach&rsquo;s bold dash, <i>c.</i> 1153-1158. Ivor ap
Meyric was Lord of Senghenydd, holding
it of William of Gloucester, the Lord of
Glamorgan, and, perhaps, had his headquarters
in the fortress above the present
Castell Coch. &ldquo;He was,&rdquo; says Giraldus
Cambrensis, &ldquo;after the manner of the
Welsh, owner of a tract of mountain land,
of which the earl was trying to deprive
him. At that time the Castle of Cardiff
was surrounded with high walls, guarded
by 120 men at arms, a numerous body
of archers and a strong watch. Yet in
defiance of all this, Ivor, in the dead of
night secretly scaled the walls, seized the
earl and countess and their only son, and
carried them off to the woods; and did not
release them till he had recovered all that
had been unjustly taken from him,&rdquo; and a
goodly ransom in addition. Perhaps the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg&nbsp;85]</a></span>
most permanent result of this episode was
the building of a wall 30 feet high between
the keep and the Black Tower&mdash;dividing
the castle enclosure into two parts and
forming an inner or middle ward of less
extent, and less liable to danger from such
sudden raids.</p>

<p>Cardiff Castle was much more than a
place of defence; it was the seat of
government. The bailiff of the Castle
was <i>ex officio</i> mayor of the town in the
Middle Ages. The Castle was also the
head and centre of the Lordship of
Glamorgan. This was divided into two
parts&mdash;the shire fee or body, and the
members. The shire fee was the
southern part; under a sheriff appointed
by the chief Lord: the chief landowners
owed suit and service&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, they attended
and were under the jurisdiction of the
shire court held monthly in the castle
enclosure, and each owed a fixed amount
of military service&mdash;especially the duty of
&ldquo;castle-guard&rdquo;&mdash;supplying the garrison
and keeping the castle in repair. There
are indications of the work of the shire
court in some of the castle accounts
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg&nbsp;86]</a></span>
published in the Cardiff Records, <i>e.g.</i>, in
1316, an official accounts for 1d., the price
of &ldquo;a cord bought for the hanging of
thieves adjudged in the county court:
stipend of one man hanging those thieves
4d.&rdquo; The &ldquo;members&rdquo; consisted of ten
lordships (several of which were in the
hands of Welsh nobles): these were much
more independent; each had its own court
(with powers of life and death), from
which an appeal lay to the Lord&rsquo;s court at
Cardiff: generally they owed no definite
service to the Lord (except homage, and
sometimes a heriot at death), but on failure
of heirs the estate lapsed to the chief Lord.
At Cardiff Castle the Lord had his
chancery, like the royal chancery on a
small scale&mdash;issuing writs, recording services
and grants of privileges, and legal
decisions: practically the whole of these
records have been lost&mdash;and our knowledge
of the organisation of the Lordship
is mainly derived from the royal records
at times, when owing to minority or
escheat, the Lordship was under royal
administration. The Lord of Glamorgan
owed homage, but no service to the king;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg&nbsp;87]</a></span>
and (though this was sometimes disputed
by his tenants and the royal lawyers), no
appeal lay from his courts to the king&rsquo;s
court. The machinery of government
was probably more complete and elaborate
in Glamorgan than in any other
Marcher Lordship.</p>

<p>Caerphilly Castle had not the political
importance of Cardiff, but far surpasses
it as a fortress. By the strength and
position of Caerphilly, one may measure
the power of Llywelyn ap Gruffydd after
the Barons&rsquo; War and before the accession
of Edward I. The Prince of Wales had
extended his sway down as far as Brecon,
and Welshmen everywhere were looking
to him as the restorer of their country&rsquo;s
independence. Among them was the
Welsh Lord of Senghenydd, one of
the chief &ldquo;members&rdquo; of Glamorgan, and
his overlord probably saw reason to
suspect his loyalty. An alliance between
him and Llywelyn would open the lower
Taff Valley to the Welsh prince and give
him command of the hill country north of
Cardiff. It was on the lands of the lord
of Senghenydd that Gilbert de Clare, Earl
of Gloucester, built Castell Coch and Caerphilly.</p>

<p class="caption">CARDIFF CASTLE. (12<sup>th</sup> Century)<br />
<br />
CAERPHILLY CASTLE. (13<sup>th</sup> Century)</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg&nbsp;89]</a></span>
Caerphilly is described by the latest
historian of the Art of War as the
grandest specimen of its class; it represents
the high-water mark of medi&aelig;val
military architecture in this country, and
was the model of Edward I.&rsquo;s great castles
in the north. It illustrates the influence
of the Crusades on Western Europe,
being an instance of the &ldquo;concentric&rdquo;
system of defences, of which the walls
of Constantinople afford the most magnificent
example, and which the Crusaders
adopted in many of their great fortresses
in the East.</p>

<p>Caerphilly Castle consists of three lines
of defences, and the way in which these
supplement each other shows that the
work in all essentials was designed as
a great whole; it did not grow up bit by
bit. There are of course many evidences
of alterations and rebuilding at later times;
the buildings in the middle ward, on the
south side, seem to be later additions; the
hall appears to have been enlarged, and
the tracery of the windows suggests the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg&nbsp;90]</a></span>
fourteenth century; the state-rooms to the
west of the hall have been much altered;
but such alterations as appear are confined
to the habitable part of the castle, and do
not affect it as a military work. It has
been suggested that the castle may have
been greatly enlarged in the latter years
of Edward II., when it played an important
part in connection with the
division of the Gloucester inheritance
and the younger Despenser&rsquo;s ambitions.
There are a number of notices of the
castle in the chronicles and public records
of that time, but apparently no references
to any building operations. And the
unity of plan is evidence that the whole
dated from the same time.</p>

<p>The castle is built on a tongue of gravel
nearly surrounded by low, marshy land,
forming a sort of peninsula; a stream
on the south running eastwards to the
Rhymny; and two springs on the north.
By damming these waters and cutting
through the tongue of gravel an artificial
island was secured for the site of the
castle. The inner ward, or central part
of the castle, consists of a quadrangle
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg&nbsp;91]</a></span>
with a large round tower at each corner:
in the centre of the east and west side
are massive gate-houses defended by
portcullises; from the projecting corner
towers all the intervening wall was commanded.
The gateways communicate
with the second line of defence or middle
ward. This completely encircles the
inner ward, on a much lower level; it is
a narrow space bounded by a wall, with
low, semi-circular bastions at the corners;
it is commanded at every point from the
inner ward; the narrowness of the space
would prevent the concentration of large
bodies of assailants or the use of
battering-rams, and communication is at
several points stopped by walls or buildings
jutting out from the inner ward. The
middle ward had strong gate-houses at the
east and west ends, and was completely
surrounded by water&mdash;east and west by
a moat, north and south the moat widens
into lakes: note how on the north a
narrow ridge of gravel has been used
to ensure a water moat on that side, in
case there was not enough water to flood
the whole lake. These lakes form part
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg&nbsp;92]</a></span>
of the third line of defence or outer ward,
which includes also on the west the &ldquo;horn-work&rdquo;
and on the east the grand front. The
horn-work is about three acres in extent,
surrounded by a wall 15 feet high, which
is of the nature of an escarpment, the
ground rising above it. It is entirely surrounded
by a moat, and connected with
the middle ward on one side and the
mainland on the other by drawbridges.
It would probably be used for grazing
purposes, and thus would be of great
value to the garrison; but so far as the
actual defences of the castle are concerned,
a lake would have been much
more effective; the nature of the ground
would however have prevented this. The
horn-work was intended to cover the only
side upon which the castle was open to
an attack from level ground, and to occupy
what would otherwise have been a dangerous
platform.</p>

<p>The eastern side of the outer ward&mdash;the
grand front&mdash;is a most imposing structure.
It is a wall about 250 yards long, and in
some parts 60 feet high, furnished with
buttresses and projecting towers from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg&nbsp;93]</a></span>
which the intervening spaces are easily
commanded, culminating in the great gate-house
near the centre, and terminating at
both ends in clusters of towers which
protect the sally-ports. On the outside
is a moat spanned by a double drawbridge.
The northern part of this front,
which was probably occupied by stables,
would in dry weather be the least defensible
part of the castle; but it was
cut off from the rest by an embattled wall
running from the gate-house to the inner
moat and pierced only by one small and
portcullised gate. The southern half
was more important and stronger. It
crossed the stream at the dam, the walls
being 15 feet thick where subjected to the
pressure of the water, and the strong
group of towers at the end&mdash;on the other
side of the stream&mdash;guarded the dam on
which the safety of the castle largely
depended; the wall and towers here form
a semicircle, curving back into the edge
of the lake, so as to avoid the danger of
being outflanked.</p>

<p>On the inside of the grand front were
various buildings, such as the mill. This
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg&nbsp;94]</a></span>
eastern line was divided from the middle
ward by a moat 45 feet wide&mdash;a space
which is too wide to be spanned by
a single drawbridge, and as there are no
signs of the foundations of a central pier,
it seems probable that the bridge rested
on a wooden support, which could be
removed when necessary, and the assailants
plunged into the moat below.</p>

<p>There are a large number of interesting
details connected with both the military
functions of the castle and its domestic
economy. There were at least four exits
(not counting the two water-gates); this
would give the garrison opportunities of
harassing assailants by sallies, and would
make a much larger army necessary in
order to blockade the castle; contrast the
single narrow entrance to the Norman
keep&mdash;high up in the wall and visible to
all outside. The water-gates are worth
studying, especially the methods of protecting
the eastern water-gate&mdash;two grates
with a shoot above and between them. One
should notice, too, the &ldquo;splaying&rdquo; of the
outer wall, by which missiles from the top
would be projected outwards; and also the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg&nbsp;95]</a></span>
use of the mill-stream to carry away the
refuse of the garderobe tower. And there
are many other points, to which one would
like to call attention, if time allowed.</p>

<p>The history of Caerphilly in the
Middle Ages need not detain us long.
It was besieged by Llywelyn in 1271,
while it was being built. Llywelyn
declared he could have taken it in three
days if he had not been persuaded to
submit the dispute to the arbitration of
the king. It is clear that the castle was
not finished; shortly after this Gilbert de
Clare obtained license from the king to
&ldquo;enditch&rdquo; the castle: such license was
not, as a rule, required in the Marches
(as it was in England) and was only
necessary now because the king was acting
as arbitrator. The Earl of Gloucester
kept possession. We next hear of it in
1315, when it resisted the attack of
Llywelyn Bren. It was then in the
hands of the king, pending the division
of the Gloucester inheritance among the
three co-heiresses. In 1318 Caerphilly,
with the rest of Glamorgan, was granted
to the younger Despenser, who perhaps
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg&nbsp;96]</a></span>
enlarged the hall and made the other
alterations referred to above. Edward II.
was there for a few days when flying for
his life; had he trusted to Caerphilly,
instead of fleeing further through South
Wales, he might have saved his head and
his crown; at any rate, there would have
been a great siege to add to the history
of medi&aelig;val warfare. The king&rsquo;s adherents
held out in Caerphilly for months,
and only surrendered when, the king
being dead, there was nothing more to
fight for, and they were allowed to go
free. Happy is the castle which has no
history. The perfection of Caerphilly as a
fortress saved it from serious attacks.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I will give two illustrations
of the relations between the garrison
of a castle and those outside. The first
refers to Swansea. There is a curious
Charter of King John to the good men
of Swansea, in which he releases them
from the &ldquo;custom of eating&rdquo; forced on
them by the men of the castle. This
would be a solid variation of the liquid
scot-ales or free drinks which officials
and garrisons were in the habit of exacting
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg&nbsp;97]</a></span>
from their neighbours, and which were
among the most persistent grievances in
the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>The second concerns Builth, and is
taken from the Patent Rolls of Edward II.
in 1315. Builth was then in the hands
of the king, to whom the townsfolk
appeal for redress of grievances. The
community complain that, though they are
only bound to carry timber to the castle
twice a week, they are often forced to
carry it three times a week and more,
and victuals too; and the men of the
castle compel them to plough their lands
and cut their corn, and hold them to
ransom if they refuse; and they carry
away from the houses of the said complainants
divers kind of victuals&mdash;lambs,
geese, hens, &amp;c.&mdash;and pay only one quarter
of their value, or nothing at all; and
though the complainants gave the keeper
of the castle &pound;120 that they might be free
from such oppressions, he took the money
and oppresses them just the same. Further,
the courts which the people have to
attend are multiplied; and recently the
court was held at a time when so great
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg&nbsp;98]</a></span>
a flood had happened that neither horsemen
nor footmen could approach the
court, and so thirty-six men and women,
fearing the cruelty of the bailiffs, entered
a boat and were overwhelmed in the rush
of the river. And one night men of the
castle, maliciously seeking occasion against
the commonalty of the town, went out of
the castle and pretended to besiege it and
shot arrows at it; and then secretly re-entered
the castle and declared the townsfolk
had been attacking the castle. And
on this account many burgesses were
imprisoned in the castle and ill-treated,
and their swine maliciously killed. And
things are so intolerable that many of the
greater burgesses have left the country,
and the residue, without speedy remedy,
cannot remain.</p>

<p>Life was evidently dull in a castle:
one had to play practical jokes to relieve
the monotony; and life was anything but
pleasant outside a castle. The castles of
Wales are much more attractive to us
to-day than they were to those who lived
in them or round them six or seven
hundred years ago.</p>

<h3>RELIGIOUS HOUSES</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N speaking of the Religious Houses
in Wales I shall deal with those
which flourished in the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries&mdash;the period we have
hitherto been studying&mdash;though it is
tempting to go back to the glories of
the old Welsh monasteries of the sixth
century, such as Llantwit Major and
Bangor Iscoed, whose dim memories must
always exercise a strong fascination. The
monasteries of this early type had fallen
on evil days in Wales, as in Ireland and
elsewhere, before the twelfth century,
many had been wiped out by the Danes;
and those that remained seem to have lost
the spirit of life (save in a few distant
islands or inaccessible mountains), and
made no struggle for existence against the
vigorous invasion of the new monasticism.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg&nbsp;102]</a></span>
We shall be concerned with two kinds
of religious houses&mdash;namely, the houses of
monks and the houses of friars. And,
first, let us consider in briefest outline the
main course of development of the religious
orders in the Roman Church. The Rule
of St. Benedict (&#8224;541) was adopted by all
monks: the essential features of it were
prayer, labour, silence, a common life and
common property. But among the early
Benedictines each monastery was independent
and self-governing, though an
abbey might have priories in some measure
connected with it. The result was that in
the course of time the discipline and life of
monasteries varied infinitely; and there
was no co-operation for self-defence among
the various monasteries. Hence in the
tenth century arose the Cluniac order&mdash;the
first attempt at organisation&mdash;the
Abbot of Clugny became head of a vast
number of monasteries in different countries
of Europe; the priors of these owed
allegiance to the Abbot of Clugny, were
appointed by him, and paid revenues to
the head abbey and the general fund of the
Order. This organisation was thus
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg&nbsp;103]</a></span>
monarchical&mdash;despotic; the Abbot of Clugny
was a pope of monasticism. The movement
acquired enormous influence on the
Church as a whole, getting control of the
papacy, insisting that the Church should
be independent of the State, and that
celibacy of the clergy should be practically
enforced. But the Cluniacs instead of withdrawing
from the world began to dominate
it, losing many of the essential features
of monasticism. Hence another reform
movement arose about 1100, that of the
Cistercian Order, which is associated with
the name of St. Bernard. This aimed at
reviving the Benedictine rule in all its
strictness, insisting especially on manual
labour. Cistercian houses were founded
in desolate places, as far removed from
populous centres as possible. But the
Order differed from the early Benedictines
in organisation. Each Cistercian house
was independent and self-governing, electing
its own abbot; but all the abbots were
bound to come together at stated times for
general assemblies or chapters, and these
general assemblies were the supreme governing
body in the Order. Thus unity was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg&nbsp;104]</a></span>
established; the organisation was close,
but not monarchical; the Order was a
great federation. This is the highest
point reached in monastic development.</p>

<p>But about the time of the Crusades
another ideal made itself felt. Hitherto
the religious man withdrew from the
world: but, as an old chronicler put it,
&ldquo;God found out the Crusades as a way
to reconcile religion and the world&rdquo;&mdash;was
it not possible to serve God <em>in</em> the
world? The knight did it; he went on
fighting, but he fought for the Holy
Sepulchre. The Military Orders (Templars
and Hospitallers) combined the life
of a monk with the life of a soldier. The
Regular or Augustinian Canons combined
the life of a monk with the life of a parish
priest. And this ideal&mdash;new to the Middle
Ages&mdash;received its highest realisation in the
Dominican and Franciscan friars. The
monk left the world in order to become
religious; the friar aimed at making the
world religious. The monk&rsquo;s main object
was to save his own soul; the friar&rsquo;s, to
save the souls of others.</p>

<p>We will now turn to the monasteries in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg&nbsp;105]</a></span>
Wales. Of the older Benedictine houses
there were about fifteen, almost all in South
Wales, and all except one were not abbeys
but priories, or cells, <i>i.e.</i>, they were dependent
on some abbey elsewhere. A number
of them belonged to some foreign abbey,
especially the earliest. This was the case
with the Priory of Monmouth, founded by
the Breton Wihenoc, which belonged to
the Abbey of St. Florence of Saumur
(Anjou); and this was the case too with
the priories of Abergavenny and Pembroke.
These &ldquo;alien priories&rdquo; were simply used
by the abbeys abroad as sources of
revenue; they were foreign, unpopular,
and during the French war in the fourteenth
and fifteenth centuries most of them
were suppressed and their revenues
appropriated by the Crown. The same
applies to the three Cluniac cells established
in Wales, such as St. Clears, which
seems only to have contained the prior
and one monk, who did not live with much
strictness, though Gerald of Barry says
the Cluniacs here were better than they
were abroad, and not nearly so bad as
the Cistercians. The life of monks in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg&nbsp;106]</a></span>
these outlying cells, where they were not
under any supervision, and where there
was no &ldquo;public opinion&rdquo; of the monastery
to keep them straight, was generally very
lax; they lived liked laymen, looking after
the estates (generally wasting them), and
without much regard to their vows: &ldquo;they
lived like beasts,&rdquo; says Gerald. Thus the
Lord Rhys had to eject the monks from
one cell, because of the charges brought
against them by the fathers and husbands
of the surrounding district, who declared
that they would leave and go to England
if the evil was not stopped.</p>

<p>Another class of houses were those
founded as priories or cells of English
abbeys. Thus the Priory at Brecon was
a cell of Battle Abbey, founded by Bernard
of Newmarch, and largely endowed by the
Braoses; Ewenny, founded by Maurice
de Londres, was a cell to St. Peter&rsquo;s,
Gloucester. All these of course, like the
alien priories, were founded by the Norman
conquerors, and for two purposes: Firstly,
for the souls of the founder and his family,
a very necessary provision; the Normans
were in their way a devout people and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg&nbsp;107]</a></span>
made sacrifices to win the favour of
heaven. William de Braose used to give
his clerks &ldquo;something extra&rdquo; for inserting
pious expressions in his legal documents.
Secondly, these houses also served as
castles and stations for garrisons. Take,
for instance, Ewenny; it is much more
like a castle than a religious house, with
its great embattled walls and towers, and
magnificent gate-house furnished with a
triple portcullis and &ldquo;shoots,&rdquo; or holes in
the roof above for pouring molten lead on
the assailants&rsquo; heads. The De Londres
family were businesslike as well as pious;
Ewenny&rsquo;s prime object was to help them
to gain heaven, it also helped them to gain
the earth. The close and constant connection
which these houses maintained
with their mother abbeys in England and
abroad always kept them Anglo-Norman
in sympathies&mdash;foreign garrisons. But
while recognising this aspect of the monastic
houses in Wales, one must avoid exaggerating
it, as, <i>e.g.</i>, Mr. Willis Bund does.
He regards all the monasteries as founded
solely with this political object: &ldquo;to
represent,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;a Welsh prince as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg&nbsp;108]</a></span>
founder of a religious house in South
Wales after 1066 is representing him as
the worst of traitors. Bad as the Welsh
chieftains were, even they would have
hesitated to introduce into their country
what were really Norman garrisons;&rdquo;
and he rejects the idea of a Welsh prince
founding Strata Florida. Now these
remarks are only applicable to those
religious houses which were dependencies
on some English or foreign abbey; they
do not apply to the Cistercian monasteries,
all of which were practically equal and
self-governing; each elected its own head
and was not under foreign dictation.
While the whole Cistercian Order formed
an united body for purposes of monastic
life and discipline, each abbey identified
itself in a very remarkable way with the local
or national aspirations of the people round,
from whom its monks were drawn. Some
of the Cistercian monasteries in Ireland
refused to admit any Englishman. Some
of the Cistercian abbeys in Wales were
the warmest supporters of Welsh independence.</p>

<p>The Welsh princes felt the need of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg&nbsp;109]</a></span>
providing for the safety of their souls
just as the Norman barons did, and the
souls of both parties needed a great deal
of saving. Further, the Welsh were not
cut off from the great movements of the
world; they felt like every other country
in Europe the waves of religious enthusiasm,
which resulted in the twelfth century
in the spread of the Cistercians, in the
thirteenth century in the spread of the
friars. In the twelfth century the acts
most pleasing to God were generally
thought to be taking the Cross and
endowing a Cistercian monastery. Again,
though many of the Welsh chiefs were
mere creatures of impulse, there were
others who looked to the future. The
Lord Rhys was an acute man of the world,
who was not averse to improving his
property. He possessed great tracts of
mountain land, which was practically
worthless; he saw Cistercian monks
elsewhere, not exactly making such tracts
blossom like the rose, but, at any rate,
utilising them for pasture land, keeping
flocks of sheep, becoming the great wool-growers
for all Europe; why should he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg&nbsp;110]</a></span>
not hand over his worthless property to
Cistercians, and by so doing lay up for
himself treasure in heaven and on earth?
Mr. Willis Bund says, &ldquo;How unnatural
for any Welsh prince to found a Cistercian
abbey!&rdquo; Surely it was the most natural
thing in the world.</p>

<p>The Cistercians had far greater influence
in Wales than any other monastic order.
The Cistercian abbeys were Aberconway,
Basingwerk, Valle Crucis, Strata Marcella,
Cymer, Strata Florida, Cwm Hir, Whitland,
Neath, Margam, Llantarnam,
Tintern, Grace Dieu, Dore. We have in
Gerald a very unfavourable and prejudiced
witness on the Cistercians. He tells with
pious horror and human satisfaction the
story of the abbot of Strata Marcella, who
was a great founder of nunneries, and at
length eloped with a nun (he soon repented
and came back to his abbey, preferring the
bread and water of affliction to the nun).
Gerald had a personal grudge against the
Cistercians; wanting to raise money he
had pawned his library to the monks of
Strata Florida, and when he tried to
redeem the books they declared they had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg&nbsp;111]</a></span>
bought them, and would not give them
up.</p>

<p>The Cistercians certainly drove hard bargains,
and insisted on their rights to the
uttermost farthing. In reading the history of
any of these Cistercian houses&mdash;the history,
say, of Margam by Mr. Trice Martin&mdash;one&rsquo;s
first feeling is one of disappointment:
it is nearly all about property. When one
looks through to find evidences of spiritual
influence one finds instead prosecutions
for poaching. Did they have schools and
teach the youth of the country round? I
have found no evidence of it. Why
should they? Monks never professed to
be learned men or to be teachers. Many
were both, but it was a disputed question
whether they were not in this contravening
their rule. At any rate, it was going outside
their duty. Their business was to
serve God&mdash;to perform divine services&mdash;and
in the intervals to keep out of mischief
by manual labour, and to perform works of
charity. Margam was specially famous for
this last.</p>

<p>Margam Abbey was founded by Robert
of Gloucester, in 1147, and the brother of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg&nbsp;112]</a></span>
St. Bernard, Abbot of Clairvaux, the most
important man in Europe in his time, came
over to arrange about the establishment of
the house. It was endowed with lands by
both English and Welsh, such as the Earl
of Gloucester and the Lord of Senghenydd.
William Marshall, Earl of Pembroke,
granted the monks freedom from toll in all
his boroughs in Wales and Ireland. The
Braoses gave them the privilege of &ldquo;buying
and selling freely all manner of merchandise
without toll&rdquo; in Gower, and they
had the right to all wrecks along the coast
near Kenfig. We find the abbot asserting
his fishing rights sometimes by excommunicating
poachers, sometimes by the
more effective method of haling them
before the Shire Court at Cardiff and
getting them fined 3d. a head. The
monks of Margam obtained also a footing
in Bristol through the Earls of Gloucester,
a great commercial advantage to them for
the sale of their wool both in England and
abroad.</p>

<p>Their lands and privileges were not
always, of course, free gifts. Thus in the
twelfth century Gilbert Burdin grants land
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg&nbsp;113]</a></span>
to Margam, and in return the abbot gives
20s. to the grantor, a gold coin to his wife,
and red shoes to each of his children. In
1325 John Nichol, of Kenfig, gave his property
to the abbey in return for a life
annuity. He was to receive daily one loaf,
two cakes, and a gallon of beer; also
6s. 8d. for wages, four pairs of shoes (price
12d.), a quarter of oats, and pasture for
two beasts.</p>

<p>The annual revenue of Margam was
returned as 500 marks in 1383, but before
that time the abbey had suffered severely
from inundations, sea and sand covering
whole villages and much of the best property
of the house; and the finances were
in a bad way. These were improved by
grants of the tithes of parish churches&mdash;a
favourite form of gift to a monastery, but
a great scandal. The rectorial tithes were
paid to a monastery, while the monks at
best put in some under-paid vicar to look
after the parish. Generally, wherever there
is a vicar instead of a rector in England or
Wales the explanation is the appropriation
of the tithes by a monastery.</p>

<p>What did Margam do with its income?
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg&nbsp;114]</a></span>
The first charge was the support of about
forty monks and forty lay brethren. Next
there were the construction and keeping in
repair of the church and other monastic
buildings; and, thirdly, the expense of
charity and hospitality. The monasteries
were the hotels of the Middle Ages, except
that they made no charges, and Margam
was celebrated for its hospitality for centuries.
Gerald, the enemy of monks, says:
&ldquo;This noble abbey was more celebrated for
its charitable deeds than any other of that
order in Wales. And as a reward for that
abundant charity which the monastery had
always, in times of need, exercised towards
strangers and the poor, in a season of
approaching famine their corn and provisions
were divinely increased, like the
widow&rsquo;s cruse of oil.&rdquo; Two centuries
later we find the Pope bearing witness
to the well-known and universal hospitality
of the Abbey of Margam. It was
placed on the main road between Bristol
and Ireland, at a distance from other places
of refuge, and so was continually overrun by
rich and poor strangers, the poor evidently
preponderating. In this connection I will
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg&nbsp;115]</a></span>
give one instance of wise charity on the
part of these monks from the end of the
twelfth century. Hugh, son of Robert of
Llancarven, gives the abbey some land in
return for &ldquo;four marks of silver and a young
ox, given to him in his great need by the
Abbot.&rdquo; The monastery performed some
of the services of the modern bank.</p>

<p>Strata Florida presents some different
characteristics. Like most Cistercian
houses, it lay off the beaten track. It
was founded in 1164 by the Lord Rhys,
near the site of an older monastery. It
was endowed with large expanse of lands,
mostly mountain pastures, and the monks
soon began building their church and refectory
and cloister. The monastery was
completed in 1201, when &ldquo;the monks came
to the new church, which had been erected
of splendid workmanship.&rdquo; The architectural
details of this church are peculiar and
almost unique. Mr. S.&nbsp;W. Williams notices
especially the large amount of interlacing
work in the carving, which one sees in the
old Celtic crosses, and which is so characteristic
of Celtic art. The convent seems to
have become very soon essentially Welsh.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg&nbsp;116]</a></span>
Nearly all the abbots have Welsh names.
It was the burial-place of the princes of
South Wales; but as they were, after the
Lord Rhys, quite unimportant, its political
interest is connected with the princes of
Gwynedd. When in the thirteenth century
the princes of North Wales were attracting
the allegiance of the South Welsh also
they found Strata Florida a convenient
place for important political assemblies.
It was here that Llywelyn ap Iorwerth
summoned all the Welsh chiefs to do
homage to his son David. The monastery
suffered damage during the wars of
Edward I., who in 1284 granted it &pound;78
for repairs. But it suffered the worst
injuries during the rebellion of Owen
Glyndwr, when the English troops used
it as a barracks, and stabled their horses in
church and choir.</p>

<p>The patriotic tone of Strata Florida is
expressed in the Welsh chronicles written
there. The later part of the <i>Annales
Cambri&aelig;</i> was written there, and the Brut y
Tywysogion. At Margam also a chronicle
was composed which has been preserved.
When an abbey decided to begin a chronicle,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg&nbsp;117]</a></span>
the first step was to borrow a chronicle
from some other house; thus Margam,
founded by Robert of Gloucester, copied
out the Chronicle of William of Malmesbury,
which was dedicated to Robert of
Gloucester. The monks of Strata Florida
copied out the earlier portion of the <i>Annales
Cambri&aelig;</i>. These chronicles of course only
became of historical value when they
become independent and contemporary.
They do not confine themselves to the
monastery or local history, but relate
events of general interest&mdash;to the whole of
Britain and to all Europe&mdash;intermixed
with notices of the burning of a monastic
barn or the death of the local abbot.
Knowledge of the great world came to an
abbey through the travellers who stayed
there; through political or ecclesiastical
assemblies held there; and through public
documents sent to the monks for safekeeping
or to be copied. We generally do
not know who wrote these chronicles; they
were rather the work of the community than
of the individual monks. &ldquo;Every year (so
runs a regulation on the subject) the volume
is placed in the <i>scriptorium</i>, with loose sheets
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg&nbsp;118]</a></span>
of paper or parchment attached to it, in
which any monk may enter notes of events
which seem to him important. At the end
of the year, not any one who likes, but he to
whom it is commanded, shall write in the
volume as briefly as he can what he thinks
of all these loose notes is truest and best to
be handed down to posterity.&rdquo; &ldquo;Thus it
was that a monastic chronicle grew, like a
monastic house, by the labour of different
hands and at different times; but of the
heads that planned it, of the hands that
executed it, no satisfactory record was
preserved. The individual is lost in the
community.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Coming now to the Friaries in Wales,
we find ourselves in a different atmosphere.
The friars were not troubled with
questions of property: they had none;
they depended for their livelihood on the
alms of the faithful. Again, speaking
generally, one may say that while the
Benedictine priory is found under the
shadow of a castle, and the Cistercian
abbey in the heart of the country, the
friaries were built in the slums of the
towns. As there were few towns in Wales,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg&nbsp;119]</a></span>
the houses of the Mendicant Orders were
not numerous or important. The Dominicans
(or Black Friars) had houses at
Bangor, Rhuddlan, Brecon, Haverfordwest,
and Cardiff; the Franciscans (or Grey
Friars) at Cardiff, Carmarthen, and Llanfaes;
the Carmelites (or White Friars) at
Denbigh; and the Austin Friars at Newport
in Monmouthshire. It is remarkable that
the Dominicans had more houses in Wales
than the Franciscans; though the Franciscans&mdash;the
mystic apostles of love&mdash;were
more in sympathy with the Celtic spirit
than the Dominicans, the stern champions
of orthodoxy. Francis of Assisi strove to
reproduce again on earth the life of Christ&mdash;in
the letter and in the spirit; and the
religious poetry of Wales in the thirteenth
century is saturated with Franciscan feeling&mdash;full
of intense realisation of the childhood
and suffering of Christ, the humanity
of God. This may be illustrated by the
following poem by a Welsh friar of the
thirteenth century, Madawc ap Gwallter:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

</div>
</div>

<p>I do not know the dates of the foundations
of the Welsh Franciscan houses; the
dates given in Mr. Newell&rsquo;s scholarly
&ldquo;History of the Church in Wales&rdquo; are
impossible. Llanfaes is said to have been
established by Llywelyn ap Iorwerth, and
Franciscan influence would come to Wales
through Thomas the Welshman, Bishop
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg&nbsp;121]</a></span>
of St. David&rsquo;s (1247), who had been
lecturer to the Franciscans at Oxford, and
was famous for his piety and learning.
Another Franciscan I wish to mention is
Friar John the Welshman, who in his old
age was employed to negotiate with the
Welsh in 1282. He had studied and
taught at Oxford and Paris, and made a
creditable show beside such intellectual
giants as Thomas Aquinas and Roger
Bacon, his contemporaries. The widespread
and lasting popularity of his works
is shown by the large number of manuscripts
and early printed editions which have come
down to us. But his chief interest and life-work
was the popularisation of knowledge
in the service of morality. He devoted
his energies to training up lecturers who
should go to the Franciscan friaries in the
chief towns in England and Wales and
teach friars and clergy the art of popular
preaching. Friar John of Wales was one
of the chief inspirers of the &ldquo;University
Extension&rdquo; movement of the Middle Ages.
These popular preachers or lecturers did
not do much for the advancement of sound
learning, because they did not study any
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg&nbsp;122]</a></span>
science for its own sake, but only for the
moral lessons they could find in it. But,
to rouse some intellectual interest in the
people at large, and stimulate their moral
sense, was a work not unworthy of the
universities; and this aim was to some
degree attained. One of the favourite
ways of spending a holiday in the Middle
Ages was to go and hear a friar preach.
Here is a summary of a friar&rsquo;s sermon
constructed after the method of Friar John
of Wales, on the relative merits of the Ass
and the Pig.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The pig and the ass live not the same
life: for the pig during his life does no
good, but eats and swills and sleeps; but
when he is dead, then do men make much
of him. The ass is hard at work all his
days and does good service to many; but
when he dies, there is no profit. And that
is the way of the world. Some do no good
thing while they live, but eat and drink
and wax fat, and then they are dragged off
to the larder of hell, and others enrich
themselves with their goods. Whereby I
know that those, who for God&rsquo;s sake live
the life of holy poverty, shall never lack
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg&nbsp;123]</a></span>
substance, because their heavenly Father
has pigs to kill. For as the good man
before the season will kill a pig or two to
give puddings to his children, so will our
Lord kill those hardened sinners before
their time, and give their goods to the
children of God. So the psalmist says:
&lsquo;The bloodthirsty and deceitful men shall
not live out half their days,&rsquo; because they
do no work to keep their bodies healthy.
Nothing is so healthful for body and soul
as honest work. Work is the life of man,
the guardian of health; work drives away
sin, and makes people sleep well at night.
Work is the strength of feebleness, the
health of sickness, the salvation of men,&mdash;quickener
of the senses, foe of sloth,
nurse of happiness, a duty in the young
and in the old a merit. Therefore it is
better to be an ass than a pig.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One of the most able of these &ldquo;extension
lecturers&rdquo; was another Welshman&mdash;probably
a native of Cardiff&mdash;Friar John David,
whose lectures at Hereford were so successful
that after a year both the friars and the
clergy of the city declared he was indispensable,
and petitioned for his reappointment.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg&nbsp;124]</a></span>
He became the head of the Franciscan
province of England, and lies buried
among the ruins of the church of the Grey
Friars in Cardiff.</p>

<h2>VI</h2>

<h3>LLYWELYN AP GRUFFYDD AND THE BARONS&rsquo; WAR</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HROUGHOUT the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries the history of
England and the history of Wales are so
closely bound up together that it is impossible
to study either apart from the
other. In illustration of this general
statement I will ask you to consider briefly
the history of twelve years, from 1255 to
1267&mdash;a period of special interest to us,
because these are the years in which
Llywelyn&rsquo;s power was founded and built
up.</p>

<p>In 1255 occurred three events of great
importance to Wales: (1) Llywelyn overthrew
his brothers in battle; (2) Edward
Longshanks took possession of his Chester
estates; (3) Edmund Crouchback was
formally proclaimed king of Sicily.</p>

<p>1. David, younger son of Llywelyn ap
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg&nbsp;128]</a></span>
Iorwerth, died in 1246, leaving no descendants,
and the Principality was seized
by the three sons of his elder brother
Gruffydd&mdash;Owain the Red, Llywelyn, and
David. For some years they held
together, because Henry III. opposed the
accession of any of them, claiming the
Principality as a lapsed fief under a treaty
made with the last prince, David ap
Llywelyn. But after a time the king
accepted the homage and recognised the
rights of the sons of Gruffydd. Being
thus freed from direct hostility of the
English king, the joint rulers soon
quarrelled, and came to open war in 1255.
&ldquo;By the instigation of the devil,&rdquo; says
the Brut y Tywysogion, &ldquo;a great dissension
arose between the sons of
Gruffydd&mdash;namely, Owain the Red and
David on the one side, and Llywelyn on
the other. And thereupon Llywelyn and
his men awaited without fear, trusting in
God, at Bryn Derwin the cruel coming
of his brother accompanied by a vast
army, and before the end of one hour
Owain was taken and David fled, after
many of the army were killed and others
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg&nbsp;129]</a></span>
captured, and the rest had taken to flight.
And then Owain the Red was imprisoned;
and Llywelyn took possession of the
territory of Owain and David without
any opposition.&rdquo; Thus Gwynedd was
united under one ruler.</p>

<p>2. It was the policy of Henry III. to
collect the earldoms into the hands of his
relations. Thus the great palatine earldom
of Chester, having lapsed to the
Crown through failure of heirs, was granted
in 1254 to the king&rsquo;s eldest son, Edward.
Besides Chester and its dependencies
Edward received Montgomery and the
royal lands in South Wales (Cardigan
and Carmarthen), Ireland and Gascony&mdash;in
fact all the territory outside England
over which the king had rights. These
possessions were calculated to give the
heir to the throne a varied experience and
splendid training in the art of government.
Edward was in need of such training, as
the story of his early years shows. He
was only sixteen years of age in 1255, but
in the Middle Ages men lived short lives
and matured very early. Edward was
married in 1254, and had much experience
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg&nbsp;130]</a></span>
in war and statesmanship before he was
twenty. It was a wild time, and young
Edward was among the wildest spirits;
as he rode through the country, accompanied
by his two hundred followers&mdash;mostly
rollicking and arrogant foreign
adventurers&mdash;who robbed and devastated
the land, and thrashed and even mutilated
passers-by for fun, people looked forward
with great fear to the accession of such a
ruffian. A few years of responsibility,
and failure, soon changed him into the
noblest and most law-abiding of the
Plantagenets. It was Wales which gave
him his first lesson. He first tried his
hand at the reorganisation of the &ldquo;Middle
Country,&rdquo; making it &ldquo;shire-land,&rdquo; introducing
the English law and administrative
system; the same policy was put in force
in Cardigan and Carmarthen, which formed
one shire with a Shiremoot and the usual
institutions of an English county. Some
Welshmen had already petitioned the king
for the introduction of English law into
Wales, complaining that by Welsh law
the crime of the guilty is visited on the
innocent relations. At best it was a task
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg&nbsp;131]</a></span>
which required very careful management,
and Edward and his advisers were as
yet quite unfitted for it, prone as they
were to violent methods, having an
insolent contempt for all customs and
habits which differed from those to
which they were used, and all classes
except their own. The result is thus
expressed by the Welsh chronicler: After
Edward returned to England, &ldquo;the nobles
of Wales came to Llywelyn, having been
robbed of their liberties and made captives,
and declared they would rather be killed
in war for their liberty than suffer themselves
to be trampled on by strangers.
And Llywelyn was moved at their tears,
and invaded the Middle Country and subdued
it all before the end of the week.&rdquo;
In this work Llywelyn was assisted by
descendants of Rhys, the princes of South
Wales, who in Cardigan suffered from
Prince Edward&rsquo;s policy in the same way
as the men of the Middle Country or Four
Cantreds. This union of North and South
Wales is one of the special characteristics
of the struggle under Llywelyn ap
Gruffydd. That the Welsh of the North
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg&nbsp;132]</a></span>
should join those of the South was, notes
Matthew Paris, &ldquo;a circumstance never
known before.&rdquo; And Llywelyn was
statesman enough to see the importance
of this union and take steps to strengthen
it. After recovering the Middle Country,
he marched south, took possession of
Cardigan and Builth&mdash;then a possession
of the Crown, though in the custody of
Mortimer&mdash;and gave these districts to
Meredydd, grandson of the Lord Rhys,
to hold as vassal&mdash;a wise measure,
intended to bind the South to him by
common interests. Matthew Paris, who
holds up the Welsh resistance to tyranny
as an example to the English, puts in
Llywelyn&rsquo;s mouth a striking speech in
favour of unity: &ldquo;Let us then stand firm
together; for if we remain inseparable we
shall be insuperable&rdquo;&mdash;the very words of
Gerald of Barry, whose advice had borne
some fruit. But Meredydd soon proved
a traitor, and the failure of Henry III.&rsquo;s
campaign in 1257 was less due to the
union of the Welsh than to the disunion
of the English.</p>

<p>3. This brings us to the third event
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg&nbsp;133]</a></span>
referred to above&mdash;the proclamation of
Edmund as King of Sicily. The Pope
was trying to conquer Sicily, but wanted
some one else to pay the war budget.
After trying various people he induced
Henry III. to accept the crown of Sicily
for Edmund and promise enormous sums
for the payment of the papal armies, and
pledge his whole kingdom as security for
the payment. This, coming on the top of
many years of misgovernment and a long
series of extortions, led directly to the
crisis of the reign&mdash;the revolution known
as the Provisions of Oxford in 1258, by
which the powers of government were
taken away from the Crown and given to
committees of barons.</p>

<p>The disaffection against Henry III. at
once made itself felt in the Welsh war.
&ldquo;Those who had promised the king
assistance did not come;&rdquo; and when the
whole knighthood of England were called
out to meet at Chester, only &ldquo;manifold
complaints and murmurs were heard.&rdquo;
We might have expected the Marcher
Lords at any rate to rally round the king;
but they were not disposed to assist in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg&nbsp;134]</a></span>
building up a royal power in Wales which
would endanger their independence, and
were glad enough to stand by and see
the scheme thwarted. Some of them
even went so far as to send secret
information to the Welsh prince. The
king had to retreat ingloriously, pursued
by Llywelyn, and followed by the
derisive sneers of the enemy. It may
interest some of us to note that in this war
the English army fought, as often, under
the Dragon standard; probably the
Dragon made in 1244 by Edward Fitz
Odo, the King&rsquo;s goldsmith, who was commanded
to make it &ldquo;in the manner of a
standard or ensign, of red samit, to be
embroidered with gold, and his tongue to
appear as though continually moving, and
his eyes of sapphire or other stones
agreeable to him.&rdquo; This was in 1257;
the king was still less able to attack
Llywelyn in 1258 and the following years,
and had to agree to an ignominious truce.</p>

<p>Almost the whole English baronage
under the leadership of Simon de Montfort,
Earl of Leicester, and Richard de
Clare, Earl of Gloucester, combined
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg&nbsp;135]</a></span>
against the king, who was only supported
by the royal family and those of
his foreign relations to whom he had
given earldoms and baronies and
bishoprics in England or Wales. If
Llywelyn had contented himself with
occupying the royal lands in Wales&mdash;the
territories granted to Edward&mdash;and with
seizing Powys, which held to the English
king, he would have had nothing to fear
at this time from the English baronage,
and the Crown was powerless to resist.
It is clear from the English chroniclers
that there was a genuine admiration for
the Welsh resistance on the part of the
English people. &ldquo;Their cause,&rdquo; says
Matthew Paris, &ldquo;seemed a just one even
to their enemies.&rdquo; But Llywelyn attacked
the great Marcher Lords; it was difficult
for a champion of Welsh patriotism to
avoid doing so&mdash;it may be also that
Llywelyn failed to grasp thoroughly the
political situation in England, as he certainly
failed to grasp it after the accession
of Edward I. The first to suffer severely
from him was Roger Mortimer, lord of the
Middle March; thus Llywelyn drove him
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg&nbsp;136]</a></span>
out of Gwerthrynion and Maelienydd, and
added these territories to his own. Successes
like these roused great enthusiasm
among the Welsh gentry, though they
excited the alarm and jealousy of some of
the princes (such as Meredydd, and
Llywelyn&rsquo;s brother David, who &ldquo;by the
instigation of the devil&rdquo; deserted the
cause and went over to the English).
But the good men of Brecon revolted from
their lord, the Earl of Hereford, and
adhered to Llywelyn, who came down and
received their homage in 1262.</p>

<p>The general situation was altered by
these events. It became clear to the
Lords Marchers that their power was
endangered by Llywelyn&rsquo;s success, and
that they must make common cause with
Prince Edward. The Lords Marchers
began to form the royalist party. Thus
Mortimer, who in 1258 was among the
leaders of the baronial opposition to the
Crown, was in 1260 acting with the king
against the barons. The Mortimers were
the most directly affected of all the
Marchers by the successes of Llywelyn,
not only because their territories lay near
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg&nbsp;137]</a></span>
Gwynedd, but because nearly all their lands
lay in or close to the Marches; they had all
their eggs in the same basket, while the
other leading Lords Marchers had large
possessions elsewhere, from which they
drew the bulk of their revenues, using
their March lands as a recruiting-ground
for their troops. Thus to the De Clares
their estates in Kent were probably worth
more as a source of income than the
whole of Glamorgan; and they also had
estates in Hertford and Suffolk and
Hampshire, and elsewhere; the Fitzalans
were great landowners in Sussex; the
Bohuns of Hereford had broad acres in
Huntingdon, Essex, and Hertford. To
these men the limitation of the royal
powers&mdash;especially of the power of taxing,
and the king&rsquo;s right to employ foreigners
in places of trust&mdash;was more important
than the checking of Llywelyn&rsquo;s advance,
which certainly weakened the king and
made it easier to enforce constitutional
rights against him.</p>

<p>Still we have here one of the causes
which broke the unity of the baronage,
which created a royalist party, and led to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg&nbsp;138]</a></span>
open war. This has hardly been enough
emphasised. It is generally said that the
question on which the barons split was the
question of the recognition of popular
representation in the government of the
country&mdash;the question, in a word, of a
House of Commons&mdash;Simon de Montfort
being the leader of the popular cause,
Richard de Clare, Earl of Gloucester (till
his death in July, 1262), the leader of the
oligarchic party, which aimed merely at
transferring the royal power to a committee
of barons. This was undoubtedly the most
important cause of the quarrel, because
it was a question of principle big with
results for the future, affecting the whole
course of English history, while the
attitude which the barons ought to take
towards Llywelyn was merely for the
barons a matter of political tactics. But
it is probable that the latter loomed larger
in the eyes of contemporaries&mdash;certainly
in the eyes of most of the Lords
Marchers.</p>

<p>Hence it came about that, when war
actually broke out in the spring of 1263, the
elder of the Lords Marchers fought on the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg&nbsp;139]</a></span>
side of the king&mdash;such as Roger Mortimer
and Humphrey de Bohun&mdash;though the
younger men&mdash;young Gilbert of Gloucester
and Humphrey de Bohun, the son of
Hereford&mdash;remained under the spell of
Simon de Montfort&rsquo;s fascination and high-minded
enthusiasm. The war began in
the Welsh Marches, Simon attacking
the forces of Edward of Chester and Roger
Mortimer&mdash;the principal royalists. As
these were also the most formidable
enemies of the Welsh, Llywelyn at the
same time attacked them from the other
side, the baronial party and Welsh co-operating,
though without any formal
alliance or friendly feelings. Thus in
1263 the baronial army besieged Shrewsbury,
which defended itself till &ldquo;a countless
host&rdquo; of Welshmen, came up and began
to attack it from the other side; the town
then surrendered to the barons lest it
should fall into the hands of the Welsh.</p>

<p>This campaign led to a very great
defection from the baronial side: the Lord
Marchers generally&mdash;such as Clifford and
Fitzalan&mdash;deserted Simon, who appeared
as a traitor to the country. How great
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg&nbsp;140]</a></span>
the defection is shown by Simon&rsquo;s words:
&ldquo;Though all should leave me, yet with
my four sons I will stand true to the just
cause, which I have sworn to uphold for
the honour of the Church and the good of
the kingdom; I have been in many lands,
pagan and Christian, but in none have I
found such faithlessness as in England.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The royalists were now the strongest
party in the Marches, and in 1264 Edward
and Mortimer gained a number of successes
over the troops of Simon and Llywelyn
(who seem to have been acting together)
and captured Brecon. But they were
called off to the main seat of war in the
Midlands, and Simon inflicted a crushing
defeat on the royalists at Lewes, in Sussex,
1264. It appears that Welsh archers
fought in Simon&rsquo;s army, but these would
be South Welsh, not North Welsh, the
troops of Gilbert de Clare, not those of
Llywelyn. The Marchers who escaped
from Lewes were followed up by Simon,
and being encircled by his forces and those
of Llywelyn, submitted in December, 1264.</p>

<p>But Simon in the hour of triumph was
now near his fall, which was made inevitable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg&nbsp;141]</a></span>
by the defection of Gilbert de Clare
and whole of the Gloucester interest. The
causes of the quarrel as given in the
chronicles are mainly personal. Simon,
with all his greatness, was quick-tempered
and overbearing, inclined to seize power
for himself, and perhaps even avaricious;
one may infer this from the statement of a
friendly chronicler, William Rishanger:
&ldquo;his habitual prayer to God was that he
would save him from avarice and covetousness
of worldly goods.&rdquo; But, apart from
merely personal questions, it is to be
noticed that the closer the relations
between Simon and Llywelyn became,
the less cordial became his relations to
Gilbert de Clare. Thus when Simon
co-operated with Llywelyn in bringing
Mortimer and the Marchers to submission in
December, 1264, Gilbert began to intrigue
with them; and soon after the famous parliament
of 1265 had transferred to Simon
the earldom of Chester&mdash;thus relieving
Llywelyn of his most dangerous neighbour,
Prince Edward&mdash;Gilbert definitely joined
Mortimer and Edward. The meeting
between the three at Ludlow is very
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg&nbsp;142]</a></span>
important; for Prince Edward now, at
the instance of Gloucester, definitely
pledged himself to the cause of reform
and good government. It may be said
for the Red Earl of Gloucester that in
deserting Simon he did not desert his
cause. To ensure the future of English
liberties it was no longer necessary to
support De Montfort: &ldquo;henceforth it
was not Simon but Edward who best
represents the cause of orderly national
progress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A few days after the desertion of
Gloucester Simon made his first formal
treaty with Llywelyn, ceding to him
Hawarden, Ellesmere, Montgomery, Maud&rsquo;s
Castle, a line of fortresses along the eastern
border, recognising his right to the title of
Prince of Wales, and to the homage of all
the Welsh barons, while Llywelyn engaged
to supply Simon with five thousand spearmen
and raid the estates of Mortimer and
De Clare. The first part of the campaign
of Evesham was carried out in Gwent.
Prince Edward held the line of the
Severn, separating Simon at Hereford
from his English partisans. Simon, while
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg&nbsp;143]</a></span>
waiting for his English supporters to concentrate,
entered Monmouthshire, where
Llywelyn&rsquo;s spearmen joined him and
ravaged the Gloucester estates, trying to
entice the royalists into Wales. Edward
followed; but&mdash;his pupil in war as in
politics&mdash;the young prince outgeneralled
him at every point, and Simon only
escaped at Newport by hurried flight
across the river, burning the bridge behind
him. He kept the Usk between him and
his enemy, but this involved a long march
north, through mountains and barren
country, and he got back to Hereford
with a half-starved army, only to find
the line of the Severn held more strongly
than ever. We cannot follow out the rest
of the campaign, marked as it was by
brilliant strategy on the part of the young
Edward, which proved him a born master
of the art of war. In the final battle all
the advantages were on his side, and one
cannot blame the spearmen of Gwynedd
for trying to save themselves by flight at
the &ldquo;murder of Evesham.&rdquo; The body of
the great Earl of Leicester was shamefully
mutilated by the conquerors, and his head
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg&nbsp;144]</a></span>
sent as a fitting present to Matilda de
Braose, wife of Roger Mortimer.</p>

<p>The struggle continued for two years both
in England and Wales. In England
Simon&rsquo;s adherents held out owing to the
severity of the terms which the victorious
party insisted on. They are known as
&ldquo;The Disinherited,&rdquo; and their cause was
championed by the two enemies&mdash;Llywelyn
and Gilbert de Clare. The &ldquo;Brut&rdquo;
states that in 1267, &ldquo;Llywelyn confederated
with Earl Clare; and then the
earl marched with an immense army to
London; and through the treachery of the
citizens he got possession of the Tower.
And when King Henry and his son
Edward heard of this they collected an
immense army and marched to London
and attacked it, and upon conditions they
compelled the earl and citizens to submit.&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Annals of Winchester,&rdquo; a contemporary
English chronicle, relate the same
event, but omit any mention of Llywelyn:
&ldquo;Earl Gilbert took London, and the Disinherited
flocked to him as to their saviour;
peace was settled in June, and many of the
Disinherited were pacified at the instance of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg&nbsp;145]</a></span>
the Earl of Gloucester.&rdquo; It is clear that
each of these rivals posed as champion of
the Disinherited, but for opposite reasons.
Llywelyn&rsquo;s object was to encourage their
resistance and keep England divided by
civil war; Gilbert&rsquo;s to insist on better
terms in order to induce them to yield.
Gilbert was successful in bringing about
peace and reform. The Disinherited were
allowed to pay a fine instead of losing all
their property, and many of the legal
reforms demanded by the baronial party
at the beginning of the struggle were
embodied in the Statute of Marlborough.
And now the Earl of Gloucester employed
his resources in strengthening his Glamorgan
lordship to resist the threatened
invasion of Llywelyn by building Castell
Coch and Caerphilly.</p>

<p>Llywelyn continued his victorious career
as long as war lasted. In 1266 he inflicted
a crushing defeat on Mortimer at Brecon.
In the autumn of next year, when peace
had been established in England, he came
to terms, through the mediation of the
papal legate, in the Treaty of Montgomery.
Llywelyn kept the four cantreds of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg&nbsp;146]</a></span>
Middle Country; also Cydewain, Ceri,
Gwerthrynion, Builth, and Brecon. But
Maelienydd was restored to Roger Mortimer,
though Llywelyn reserved his right
to appeal to the law against this article.
Further, the Prince of Gwynedd received
the hereditary title of Prince of Wales, and
was recognised as overlord of all the
Welsh barons in Wales, except Meredydd
ap Rhys, who remained immediate vassal
of the King of England: his territories
therefore in the Vale of Towy were withdrawn
from the power of Llywelyn. The
Prince of Wales in return did homage
and agreed to pay him 25,000 marks
by instalments. The treaty is less
favourable to Llywelyn than that of 1265.
His rights in Deheubarth were curtailed,
and he gave up his claims to Ellesmere
and Montgomery, and possession of
Maelienydd.</p>

<p>The papal legate who arranged the
treaty is not to be congratulated on his
draftsmanship. Many things were left
undecided, and a series of disputes arose.
Thus Llywelyn seems to have claimed
suzerainty over the Lord of Senghenydd
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg&nbsp;147]</a></span>
as one of the &ldquo;Welsh barons,&rdquo; though
that term was surely only meant to include
the Welsh barons who held directly of the
king, not the vassals of the Lord of
Glamorgan. But it is evident that
Llywelyn did not try to abide by the
treaty. He continued to intrigue with
the English barons, posing as the successor
of Simon de Montfort, and failing
to see that Edward I. was the political
heir of the great earl. He tried to throw
off the suzerainty of England, with the
result that he lost the independence of his
country. He lived in an atmosphere of
enthusiasm and flattery, and failed to
realise the limits of his power. The bards
by whom he was surrounded exercised a
&ldquo;highly pernicious influence in practical
concerns,&rdquo; and ill-repaid his generosity
by urging him to attempt the impossible.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;His bards are comely about his tables,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have seen him generously distributing his wealth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his meadhorns filled with generous liquors.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I never returned empty-handed from the North.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bards prophesy that he shall have the government and sovereign power;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Every prediction is at last to be fulfilled.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg&nbsp;148]</a></span>
But if Llywelyn lacked the hard head
of the practical statesman, if he did not,
like his grandfather, merit the title of &ldquo;the
Great,&rdquo; he will always remain an attractive
and striking figure in history; he possessed
qualities which made him an ideal representative
of the Cymric race in the
Middle Ages:&mdash;</p>
